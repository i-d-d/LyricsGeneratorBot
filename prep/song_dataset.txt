Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Can I breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Fear of living on, natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air, got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard, kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way for reaching out again

Searched the seas of gold

Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade

Withered in every place

And what you have put others through
Death, deliverance for you for sure

And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor, blood, guts and sweat

It's not who you are, it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges and build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself
Holier than thou

You know not
Ya, who the hell are you?
Ya, ha you
Holier than thou

New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles
On and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee unforgiven
They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see
No longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me

Sleep and dream of this
Death angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely
Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay?
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Ooh, call your name
Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore
Wait, wait patiently
Your death black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading o'er me
Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay?
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Ooh, call your name
Suicide, I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide, living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore
Say, is that rain or are they tears?
That stained your concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life
An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, oh peace at last
Empty they say
Death, won't you let me stay?
Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name
Suicide, I've already died

Alright
Scanning the scene in the city tonight
We're looking for you to start up a fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains but it's nothing new
You know it drives us insane
Running on our way, hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Running on our way, hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take anymore
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You've always been taking and now you're giving
Running on our way, hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Running on our way, hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Searching, seek and destroy
Our brains are on fire with a feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try running away 'cause you're the one we will find
Running on our way, hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths
Running on our way, hiding you will pay
Dying one thousand deaths

Rumors going 'round, gotta clear out of town
Smellin' like a dry fish bone
Here come the law, gonna break down the door
Carry me away once more
Never, never, never want it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you
Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon
And she's playing on the saxophone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you, hey
Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
Fully loaded Tommy gun
Here comes the deputy, tryin' fucking getting me
Gotta fucking get up and run

Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant 'til I fall
Soldier boy, made of clay, now, an empty shell
Twenty one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away
Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die
Back to the front, you coward
You servant, you blind man
Barking of machine gun fire, does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you bare, glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends

Twenty one, only son but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away
Back to the front, you will do what I say, when I say
Back to the front, you will die when I say, you must die

Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
Why, am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend, alone I clench my gun
Soldier boy, made of clay, now, an empty shell

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offence
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination
Keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward
Seems to me absurd
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it, what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside to each his own
Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smokescreen
I see through the selfish lie
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it, what you read
You can do it your own way

Freedom of choice is made for you my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence
Lengthen freedom's ring
Doesn't matter what you see

Freedom of choice is made for you my friend

Until the war will start again, start again

Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure

Whisper things into my brain

Feed my brain with your so-called standards

See through your blurry sight

A vow unto his own

To running all of his 
He tries to please then all

To die regretfully

Tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me
Mirror, mirror upon the wall
Break this spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pins
So the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of another
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust
But tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin, jab another pin in me
Yeah, jab it
[Incomprehensible] the pins
Blood for face, sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse a ritual due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun, pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faith which way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love, to fall in love
To fall in love with life again
So tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or fix this hole in mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
Jab another pin, jab another pin in me
Oh yeah
No more pins in me, yeah
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no

Whiskey In The Jar (Traditional)



(Has also been recorded by Thin Lizzy)
As I was going over the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said "stand and deliver or the devil he may take you"
Yeah
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money, yeah, and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she loved me, no, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy
Musha rain dum-a-do-dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Taking Molly with me, but I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven, yeah, in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired my pistols, and I shot him with both barrels, yeah
Musha rain dum-a-do-dum-a-da, yeah-yeah
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o

Now some men like the fishing and some men like the fowling
And some men like to hear, to hear the cannonball a-roaring

But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

Some Kind Of Monster
These are the eyes that can't see me
These are the hands that drop your trust
These are the boots that kick you around
This is the tongue that speaks on ths inside
These are the ears that ring with hate
This is the face that'll never change
This is the fist that grinds you down
This is the voice of silence no more
These are the legs in circles run
This is the beating you'll never know
These are the lips that taste no freedom
This is the feel that's not so safe
This is the face that you'll never change
This is the god that ain't so pure
This is the god that is not pure
This is the voice of silence no more

This is the moment that needs to breathe
These are the claws that scratch these wounds
This is the pain that never leaves
This is the tongue that whips you down
This is the burden of every man
These are the screams that pierce your skin
This is the voice of silence no more
This is the test of flesh and soul
This is the trap that smells so good
This is the flood that drains these eyes
These are the looks that chill to the bone
These are the fears that swing over head
These are the weights that hold you down
This is the end that will never end
This is the voice of silence no more

Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your body's waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lips
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the Phantom Lord
Victims falling under chains
You hear them crying dying pains
Fists of terror's breaking through
Now there's nothing you can do
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the Phantom Lord
The leather armies have prevailed
The Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume, metal sound
Hear the cry of war, louder than before
With his sword in hand to control the land
Crushing metal strikes on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees for the Phantom Lord
Fall to your knees
And bow to the Phantom Lord

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labeled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
And cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium, leave me be
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Sanitarium, just leave me alone
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again

Satan's Fall 
They're walking by the night 
The moon has frozen blue 
Long black coats a shelter for the rain 
Their load must get through 
Now bats are leaving their trees 
They're joining the call 
Seven satanic Hell preachers 
Heading for the hall 
Bringing the blood of a newborn child 
Got to succeed, if not it's Satan's fall 
Curse Of The Pharaohs 
Away out in Egypt in the valley of kings 
Where the mummified pharaohs 
Pretend dead in their sleep 
Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you 
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly 
Just destroying your future 
Makin' it all shady 
Don't touch, never ever steal 
Unless you're in for the kill 
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs 
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you 
A Corpse Without Soul 
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse 
I'm a corpse without soul 
Satan, he's taken, he's taken 
He's taken his toll 
And he took it on me 
I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped 
I'm trapped in his spell 
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going 
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell 
Into The Coven 
Howl like a wolf 
And a witch will open the door 
Follow me and meet our high priestess 
Come, come into my coven 
And become Lucifer's child 
Undress until you're naked 
And put on this white coat 
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring 
Come, come into my coven 
And become Lucifer's child 
Evil 
I was born on the cemetery 
Under the sign of the moon 
Raised from my grave by the dead 
And I was made a mercenary 
In the legions of Hell 
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane 
You know my only pleasure 
Is to hear you cry 
I'd love to hear you cry 
I'd love to see you die 
And I'll be the first 
To watch your funeral 
And I'll be the last to leave 
I'd love to hear you cry 
And when you're down beyond the ground 
I'll dig up your body again 
And make love to shame 
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye 
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye 
You've gotta say goodbye 
'Cause I will eat your mind

Small town boy, big time frown
Never talks, never plays
Different path, lost his way
The streets are red, red I'm afraid
There's no confetti, no parade
Nothing happens in this boring place

Now they all pray
Blood stain wash away
He said, "Lost my way
This bloody day, lost my way"
I heard him, he said, "Lost my way
This bloody day, lost my way"
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today
I always said something wrong
With little strange Ronnie Long
Never laughed, never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles
Gallows calls, son, I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys how they soon change
Now they all pray
Blood stain wash away
He said, "Lost my way

When Ronnie moved to this place
He said, "Don't you dare ask
Why I'm cursed to wear this face"
Now we all know why
The children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocket
They all fall down, down, down
He said, "Lost my way
This bloody day, lost my way", yeah, yeah,
I heard him, he screamed, "Lost my way
This bloody day, lost my way"

Light my candles, in a daze

I'm so lonely, that's okay I shaved your head

Just about a mile from here
His head was found in a driving wheel
But his body never was found

Bitten by a dog with a rabbit tooth

Many a hand scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belonged to strangers and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills, shake the many hands

Nothing on top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
See a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words?

When you've finished with the mop
Then you can stop and look at what you've done
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
And the work, it was fun

You will make God happy
And if you do what's true
You will make me happy
I'll keep you in a jar
And you will seen happy

And if you save yourself
You will make him happy
He'll bring you fine rewards
Then you will feel happy
I'll keep you in my room

And if you save your soul
You will think you're happy now

You're in a laundry room

Dazed And Confused
Been dazed and confused for so long 
It's not true,
Wanted a woman never bargained for you.
Lots of people talk and few of them know,
Soul of a woman was created below.

You hurt and abused telling all of your lies,
Run arounds sweet baby lord how they hypnotize.
Sweet little baby I don't know where you've been,
Gonna love you baby here I come again

Every day I work so hard bringing home my hard earned pay
Try to love you baby but you push me away.
Don't know where you're going only know just where you've been,
Sweet little baby I want you again.

Been dazed and confused for so long it's not true,
Wanted a woman never bargained for you.
Take it easy baby let them say what they will.
Won't hurt so much when I send you the bill

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to Heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again till the fourth of July

I knew a lady who came from Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon

Now the people cry and the people moan
And they look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils fight to claim them for their own

She asks me to untie her

Your life is shit, shit
Your life is bogus, bull
Your life is crime, crime

I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna die, with my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna die, don't fuck with me

Your life is shit, shit
Your life is clean, it's clean
Your life is lame, it's not so funny
Your life is stale, frail, frail

Your life is shit

I'm gonna open up myself a flea market
I'm gonna open up myself a flea market
And you're gonna wish that you did
And retire on the profits

First off, I'm gonna empty out all of my Mrs. Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put 'em on a shelf
With my 800 dollar a month tax free Century21 shop
And then I am going to put my Mrs. Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups
I've accumulated over the past 62 years

Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood
And cut them up into two by two feet squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap
And I'm going to cut them into two by two feet squares
And then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach
And I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood

And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood
And glue them onto the plywood and burlap
And sell 'em for lots of money
People will be paying top dollar
For my kids' new used new toys and clothing
Then maybe someday I can get rid of that piss-stained mattress
I've been sleeping on

I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna hell on my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna die on my libido

I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna die on my libido

Help Me I'm Hungry
Hold me, there's too much tension
Grade me, I'm fucking hungry
Help me, I'm fucking cornered
Grade me, you might be right

Lightning fucking around in my head
Fierce, dangerous, pathetic, fucked up
People freaking every day
White lights inside
What do you want

Cold naked man, picked off his scabs and
Fed them to the pigeons
Help him, he's fucking cornered
Grade him it might be fun

Lightning fucking around in my head, etc...

Hold me, something's happening
Help me, somebody help me
Hold me, I'm fucking hungry
Help me, I'm right here, who are you?

Naked man you say you saw
Fed them, to the pigeons
Help him, he's fucking cornered

Immigrant Song
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
The hammer of the gods,
Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde singing and crying:
"Valhalla I am coming!"

On we sweep,
With thrashing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.

We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
Sultry fields of green,
Whispered tales of lore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war,
We are your overlords.

On we sweep,
With thrashing oar.
Our only goal will be the western shore.

So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day despite all your losing.

My Best Friends Girl
You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise
Here she comes again
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
She'll make you flip
Here she comes again
When she's dancing 'neath the starry sky
You kinda like the way she dips

She's my best friend's girl
She's my best friend's girl

And she used to be mine
You've got your nuclear boots
And your drip dry glove
And when you bite your lip
It's some reaction to love

We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said, I was his friend

Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long, long time ago

Oh, no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed

I gazed a gazely stare
We walked a millions years
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

Who knows?
Not me, I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

Who knows?
Not me, we never lost control
You're face to face

As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all those sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again

The careless whispers of a good friend

Last night, I saw that beauty queen
Watched her paint her face on
Wanna be that magazine
That she bases life on

Wanna waste her monthly blood
Wanna get some on my love
Wanna get some gasoline
Burn her house down

She got nothing to say
She's got bills to pay
She's got no one to hate
Except for me

Last night, I saw that beauty queen
Getting high on Revlon
Wanna be that magazine

Burn her house down

She's got bills to pay
She's got no one to hate
But except for me, me

When I saw that beauty queen
Watched her paint her face on
I wanna be the one unclean
She wipes her ass on

Wanna waste her monthly blood
Wanna get some on my love

She takes pills for pain

This fear has been chilled down to the bone
And I have been haunted by these things I still have left to say
I'm weary of fighting this alone
So tired of holding on to strings much better left to fray

And I said, hear me now, here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this seems so complicated
When all I want is just the truth

I'm wilted and faded after all
Too strung out and burnt to be half the man that I could be
I'll never belong inside your world
So blackout the sun and leave me to play out the same old tragedy

And I said, hear me now, here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out and this seems too complicated
When all I want is just the truth

Hear me now, here and now I'm calling
Memories ware me out and this seems too complicated
But all I want is just the truth

You're my savior after all
Use your flame to guide me home
And then lay your hand on me

And I said, hear me now, here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me down and this seems so complicated
When all I want is just the truth

Hear me now, here and now I'm calling
Memories wear me out and this seems too complicated

Never in distress?
Or can you picture then
Only used to pride
Ourselves on neatness?

I can't understand

Made me wild
Then you tied my hands
You tied my hands

Can you remember when
When we used to laugh
At those mistakes we made?
Can you picture then
How we used to drive
And never reach the end?

'Cos I can't understand
What you meant to me
Made me wild

I met a girl who hated the world
She used her body to sell her soul
Every time they'd break her and pay
Tear out her heart and leave her in pain

I never found out how she survived
All of the sadness and pain kept inside
I never found out how she could lie
With a smile on her face and the scratches she'd hide

You could love her if you paid
You could have her everyday
You could love her if you prayed
You could have her every way

Down on her knees, she wept on the floor
This hopeless life she wanted no more
Dead in her mind and cold to the bone
She opened her eyes and saw she was alone

She never found out how much I tried
All of the sadness she kept made me blind
She never found out how much I cried
The rope so tight on the night that she died

You could love her if you paid
You could have her everyday
You could love her if you prayed
You could have her every way

I never found out how she survived
A life lived in lies is a life of denial
I never found out how she could lie
With a smile on her face and the darkness inside

You could love her if you paid
You could have her everyday
You could love her if you prayed
You could have her every way

You could love her if you paid
You could have her everyday
You could love her if you prayed
You could have her every way

To let you in again, or forgive you

Knowing I never did, but I miss you

Faking, forsaken and failing
My memories are all stained again

Let me get inside your head
Let me show you I'm prepared
Let me stick my needles in
And let me hurt you again

I never reached my indecision
To let you see again, all I give you
Sick of feeding your attention
Knowing I never did, I distress you

Faking, forsaken and failing

Vacate is a word
Vengeance has no place so near to her
Cannot find a comfort
In this world

Artificial tears
The vessel's stabbed
Next up, volunteers
Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere

A truant finds home
And a will to hold on
There's a trapdoor in the sun
It's immortality

As privileged as a whore
Victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks
Beneath the door

Holier than thou, how?
Surrendered, executed anyhow
Scrawls dissolved
Cigar box on the floor

A truant finds home
And a will to hold on to
There's a trapdoor in the sun

It's immortality

I cannot stop the thought
Running out the door
Coming up a which way sign
And all good truants must decide

Oh, stripped and sold, mom
And an auctioned forearm
And whiskers in the sink

A truant finds home
And a will to hold on to
Some die just to live, oh

Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me
And speak but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore you see
It aches in every bone, I'll die alone, but not for you
My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing, I know it's me you fear
If you want me hold me back

Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail
And so we go back to the remedy
Clip the wings that get you high, just leave them where they lie
And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me"

I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away
So come sit by the fire and play a while, but you can't stay too long

If you want me hold me back

Frail, the skin is dry and pale, the pain will never fail

Cannot find a comfort in this world
Artificial tears, the vessel's stabbed, next up, volunteers

There's a trapdoor in the sun

As privileged as a whore, victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door
Holier than thou, how, surrendered executed anyhow
Scrawls resolved, cigar box on the floor

As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
'Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I dance with you

I'm never gonna dance again
'Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend

Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

They call me on and on across the universe.
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box,
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Sounds of laughter, shades of love are ringing through my openedears,
Inciting and inviting me.
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a millionsuns,
And calls me on and on across the universe.

As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
'Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I dance with you

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
'Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I dance with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say

We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
Now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
'Cause guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given

Clip the wings that get you high, just leave them where they lie

I'm Broken
I wonder if we'll smile in our coffins while loved ones
 Mourn the day, the absence of our faces, living, laughing,
 Eyes awake. Is this too much for them to take?
 Too young for ones conclusion, the lifestyle won.
 Such values you taught your son. That's how.
 Look at me now. I'm broken.
 Inherit my life.
 One day we all will die, a cliched fact of life. Force fed
 To make us heed. Inbred to sponge our bleed. Every
 Warning, a leaking rubber, a poison apple for mingled
 Blood. Too young for ones delusion the lifestyle cost
 Venereal Mother embrace the los$. That's how
 Look at you now. You're broken

I see you had your mind all made up, you group of pitiful liars
Before I woke to face the day your master plan transpired
Something told me this job has more to meet the eye
My song is not believed? My words somewhat deceiving?

You've waged a war of nerves but you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are, can't leave the scar torn
You cry for compensation, I ask you please just give us
5 minutes alone, 5 minutes alone

I read your eyes, your mind was made up you took me for a fool
You used complexion of my skin for a counter racist tool, you can't burn me
I've spilled my guts out in the past taken advantage of
'Cause you know where I've come from, my past

You've waged a war of nerves but you can't crush the kingdom
Can't be what your idols are, can't leave the scar torn
I'll bury your compensation, I ask you please just give us

Almost every day
I see the same face 
On broken picture tube
It fits the attitude
If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yourself
Not lie and make you believe
What's evil is making love
and making friends
and meeting God you're own way
The right way

(Chorus)To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile

We stand alone

The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped -- they ran!
Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me
I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a god

Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven/hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching say your prayers
Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
Who's about to take the ultimate test in life
I'd question things because I am human
And call NO ONE my father who's no closer that a stranger

I won't listen

Nobody touches us at all
Showdown, shootout, spread fear within, without
We're gonna take what's ours to have
Spread the word throughout the land
They say the bad guys wear black
We're tagged and can't turn back

And you all together run for cover
We're takin over this town

Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen my friend, you see
A pistol's down below
Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell
Deed is done again, we've won
Ain't talking no tall tales friend
'Cause high noon, your doom
Comin' for you we're the cowboys from hell

Pillage the village, trash the scene
But better not take it out on me
'Cause a ghost town is found 
Where your city used to be
So out of the darkness and into the light
Sparks fly everywhere in sight
From my double barrel, 12 gauge,
Can't lock me in your cage

You see us comin'
And you all together run for cover
We're takin over this town

Here we come reach for your gun
And you better listen my friend, you see

Aimed at you we're the cowboys from hell

The reverend he turned to me
Without a tear in his eyes
It's nothing new for him to see
I didn't ask him why
I will remember
The love our souls had
Sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see
Now is your (face)

Well I guess 
You took my youth
I gave it all away
Like the birth of a 
New-found joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died
I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
Memories now unfold.

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the 
Cemetery gates

Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free

Belong to me at last
Through all those
Complex years
I thought I was alone

I didn't care to look around
And make this world my own
And when she died
I should've cried and spared myself some pain...
Left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

The way we were
The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain
Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

 To rise beyond Jesus.

 I found my life was slipping through my hands. Perhaps
 Through death my life won't be so bad.

I'm close with his mother
And she cries endlessly
Lord how we miss him
At least what's remembered
It's so important to make best friends in life
But it's hard when my friend sits with blank expressions

No one knows
What's done is done
It's as if he were dead

He as hollow as I alone now
He as hollow as I alone
A shell of my friend
Just flesh and bone
There's no soul
He sees no love

Hear my words before it's through

 While you snored and drooled, I fucked your love.
 She called me Daddy. And I called her baby when I
 Smacked her ass. I called her sugar when I ate
 Her alive till daylight. And I slept with her all
 Over me, from forehead to ribcage I dripper her ass.
 Sometimes I thought you might be spying, living out some
 Brash fantasy, but no. You were knocked out. But we were
 All knocked out you know. In a way
 I serve too many masters.
 We didn't know you'd break the bottle that the magic
 Came in to use those jagged shards to slit our wrists
 And neck. And you'd do it too, you're that kind of dude.
But you wouldn't know what you were doing because
 I didn't, your girlfriend could have been a burn
 Victim, an amputee, a dead body. But god damn I wanted
 To fuck.

I don't want you to look at me while I'm shedding
 Skin. I can't afford for you to see what's inside me.
 I'd rather shoot myself than have you watch me. I
 Feel you'd steal my skin to try and wear me.
 I was betrayed, one more day of my short life. You were
 Carried away. You had no shame. To suffocate my being.
 I was me, but you weren't you. You were sticking to me like
 a scab...so I peeled you away, and bled for days. Then
 Stepped out of myself.
I'm shedding skin, changing within, I'm falling in.
Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.
 I don't think you belong in here, I feel I'm sick. Don't ask because
 You know damn well where I've been. I've kept a simple
 Woman through the thick and thin. But I've found the guts
 to sever from my Siamese twin.
 I throw you away. Everyday. A dead part of life. Strangling
 back. Seething black. In between my longing for torture.
 Blood on my face that came from your face. The mix
 Of kissing and bleeding. I put you away. I shut you away.
 I pissed you away. I threw you away.

Through swollen eyes, I dreamed you died, caught inside.
I'm shedding skin, spreading thin, severed stem.
I created the end, I'm killing a friend. I'm shedding my skin.
 You're fucking, and sucking. You're friendless. It's endless.
 Your flower has soured. It's endless. You're friendless.
 It's harder. And stronger. But no one's been inside you longer.
 Or harder. Or deeper. To get you off, you need the fear.
 It's never love. Bloody touch. Broken wrist. Needle rust.
 Choking throat. Swallowed teeth. Head fuck. No peace.
 I'm shedding my skin to peel you off of me.
 You've got to love me.
 Ornament. Shrunken head. Playtoy. Snake strike. Poisonous.

 I'm shedding my skin to drain you out of me.

 You're working for perfect bodies, perfect minds and perfect

 You're muscle and gall. Naive at best. I'm bone, brain and

 Tried, but it's words of a weakling and promises made
 By a drunken liar [fucking liar]. Now you pick up that splintered
 Chair, that was aiming for your head. A head that should
 Have been long ago kicked in by me. Alone.

 Orphaned to the dope and drinks, I learned my lesson well,
 Somehow(?), from you. No tears. Can't clutch my regrets.
 But these years of detachment have left me with
 Demons now surfacing. But I'm becoming more than nothing.

 You made up all the answers to my unimportant existence.
 But now you don't have to dump me off, not again...
 Don't touch me again.

 You'll never be the father I am. The bastard father to
 The thousands of the ugly, criticized, the unwanted. The

 Simply to thy ghost I reject.
 Simply to thy ghost I give spit.

Imprison myself

Don't understand so they hate me now

My fear grips the will of stone
My fear grips I'll die alone

I promised myself somewhere in the teenage life
I'd never submit to the ones I will not be like
Live in a hole
But stay close to my kind
Cause they understand what burns in my mind
I still feel incomplete

There's a problem with race 
Because of ignorant past burned fires

We've been killing each other
I figure man should have it down to a science


No chance
Not for a minute
Not for a second 
I won't be defensive
I'm straight out in my opinion
You'ld better listen to a man who knows what he is saying
I've seen your side
You run and hide for the mere fact that you feel inferior
Be superior
And know your interior

This land of fools will rise
No good
For no one

You blame oppression and play the role of criminals
To rape and burn show progress is minimal
White hoods and militants you know it's such a pity
Living, breathing
Violence in your city


If one man
Had one home
In one world
Held live alone without variety
Full of anxiety
No one to point at, question
Or even talk to -- in his private grave
No matter what color
He wouldn't be saved from hell
He dwells
A closed mind playing the part of prison cells

Head lying in your hands
Shaking in the corner
Done too much alcohol
Gotta get away from it all
'Cause it feels my blood is freezing
My self insanity has taken its toll
Frustration has taken its control

Now I'm far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set my demons free
Been put to the test
My mind laid to rest
I'm on a psycho holiday

Shot down on sight
You are the target of attention
One woman here another there
You can't please all the people all the time
Can't tell the strangers 
From the friends you know
Frustration has taken it's control

Now you're far from home
Spending time alone
It's time to set your demons free
Been put through the test
Your mind laid to rest
You're on a psycho holiday

I'm strapped in for life
Is this where I lived
Or where I died
You want my money 
You take my space
My mind is telling me
To leave this place
My self insanity has taken its toll
Frustration has taken its control

There's a place that I keep deep inside me
It can trigger my mind
All along I knew it has been with me
Since I was just a child

I just summon power within my soul
It has given me life, beyond life I take
Blame for my murderous problem my signature
Always reminds

It's a message in blood
It's your cryptic warning
Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain,
And your godforsaken ending to life

I'm provoked into sick confrontations, brutal
Time after time, bed of nails, suffocation,
life's ending, slay in different designs
One mans misery is another mans mystery
No one cares to understand my
Demented means
Sticks and stones can break all your
brittle bones, epitaph written at your feet

Within the message in blood
Marks the years of pain,

Reason to fight
Sacrifice, die for pride

Without a label or a face

Overwhelming with euphoric lift
To lure you to steal your gift

Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go

Understand just take his hand
He's the medicine man

Once proud and fearless men
With desire in their eyes
Lost strong and fruitful lives
To self-indulgent ties
Their souls were dipped in venom
And put into a box
Then placed upon a crowded shelf
Where countless souls now rot
Have you ever wondered what hell's like?
He can take you there
Just one taste and you'll be back
And by the high you'll swear

Seeping down to the bone
And there's no question
Where you have to go

Listen up good, I got a lot to say
I know what I want and I get my own way
I call 'em as I see 'em, I don't play by the book
One dose of volume that's all it took

I've seen it, I've done it, I've heard it before
Now it's my turn to settle the score
I'll sing it, I'll shout it, I'll say it again
I don't care if they never give in 'cause I'm

Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
You know I'm proud
Proud to be loud

Well, I've always believed in freedom of speech
And I've always been the one who practiced what I preached
Love it or leave it, I'll give you the choice
But it'll snow in hell before I lower my voice

I live it, I breathe it, I gotta have more
It's full blast and this means war
The power, the glory, it's callin' my name
I won't start to play their game 'cause I'm

Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
I'M proud to be loud
And I'll never turn it down again, no

She loves a thrill, she'll take it anywhere

Won't be there, she's never there

Happens every time, never givin' her love
Only givin' you lies, she'll put you through hell

I can't win, she drives me insane
Broken heart is the name of her game
Down on my knees beggin' to please
Needin' her love

All alone out on the street
She was layin' me out
Knocked me off my feet

Happened before us
We are confined to a 
Darkened hidden tomb
The conquering of our world

Rise above this pit
Of sorrow and pain
Among the few
We are the avant leaders
We've got to live
Through this trouble and decay

This question haunts my mind
Will we survive this night?
We're harboring the meek
Will we survive the sleep?

Unsure and scared
We are planning our reprise
Revolves around this world
We don't know anymore

Yet we're stronger and prevailing
Learn from mistakes
Counting souls for sale

Can't Hide
I've written about my inner wars, 
but i could give a shit about right now, 
most of me is all strength 
and all of me is at war with dope 
but my eyes are clear in sight 
my guts are blazing, 
i might have a life 

I can't hide, to erase, what I've done- 
last year, and the years before 
It still takes assholes of all kinds 
on that fact I am still clear, 
(cause) I should know and now I do 
I'm one of them 
I'm just like you 
I'm just like you 
A man that stands his ground with strength 

Last year, and years before 
Can't hide myself 
I won't try 
It makes me strong

It blows away the depression inside 
It blows away the mental withdrawal

On broken picture tube

If you could see yourself
You put you on a shelf
Your verbal masturbate
Promise to nauseate
Today I'll play the part of non-parent
Not make a hundred rules
For you to know about yoursef
Not lie and make you believe
What's evil is making love
and making friends
and meeting God you're own way
The right way
(Chorus)
To see
To bleed
Cannot be taught
In turn
You're making us
Fucking hostile
We stand alone
The truth in right and wrong
The boundaries of the law
You seem to miss the point
Arresting for a joint?
You seem to wonder why
Hundreds of people die
You're writing tickets man
My mom got jumped -- they ran!
Now I'll play a public servant
To serve and protect
By the law and the state
I'd bust the punks
That rape steal and murder
And leave you be
If you crossed me
I'd shake your hand like a man
Not a god
(Chorus)
Come meet your maker, boy
Some things you can't enjoy
Because of heaven/hell
A fucking wives' tale
They put it in your head
Then put you in your bed
He's watching say your prayers
Cause God is everywhere
Now I'll play a man learning priesthood
Who's about to take the ultimate test in life
I'd question things because I am human
And call NO ONE my father who's no closer that a stranger
I won't listen

That's how
Look at me now

I'm broken
Inherit my life

One day we all will die
Clichéd fact of life
Force fed to make us heed
Inbred to sponge our bleed
Every warning, a leaking rubber
A poison apple for mingled blood

Too young for ones delusion
The lifestyle cost
Venereal mother, embrace the loss

I'm taken by the one I was saving
From death

By demons be driven
Beckon the call

With decline in mind
End not far
We're left hanging alone here
He pulls us from nails
Shatters our bones
Leaving us crippled and strewn
Boiling my corpse in the blood of his children
Praying for his god to prevail
Burying us with loved ones
To sleep with shelled children of the sixth dimension

Warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you'd better hide
From the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky
Turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay,
Radiation minds decay

Robot minds of robot slaves
Lead them to atomic rage
Plastic flowers, melting sun,
Fading moon falls upon
Dying world of radiation,
Victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of oxy'n fire,
Like electric funeral pyre

Buildings crashing down
To a cracking ground
Rivers turn to wood,
Ice melting to flood
Earth lies in death bed,
Clouds cry water dead
Tearing life away,
Here's the burning pay

Electric Funeral

As a child I was given the gift to entertain you.
But through blood I inherited a life that could destroy you.

I drink all day. I smoke all day.
I took Madonna's breath away
I've done it all but tap the vein.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks are text book reasons
All these Christians come alive and try to sell you

My soul for a goat, yet I'll outlive the old.

You know it's bad, some may say sad,
a hangover is inspiration.
Like a junkie I hurt for it.
A bad trip, the emptiness.

I never sleep, or always sleep
a lack of fulfillment to me is me.
The big picture.
These hard lines and sunken cheeks
are part of what the Christians mean
to immortalize my situation.

My soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old.

Embrace some religion.
To get close to some undivine ejaculation point.
Simply to thy ghost I cling.
Simply to thy ghost I reject.
Simply to thy ghost I give spit.

Tempter, tempting, tempt me. Molest me.
You know that I'll submit.
For this is my weakness
and it saves me from relationships
With those Christians you know they'll sell you

My soul for a goat. Yet I'll outlive the old.

If ever words were spoken
Painful and untrue
I said I loved but I lied
In my life
All I wanted
Was the keeping
Of someone like you
As it turns out
Deeper within me
Love was twisted and pointed at you

Never ending pain, quickly ending life

You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you

I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love, love, love
You keep this love, love, love

Deaf ears are sleeping
A guilty bliss, so inviting (let me in)
Nailed to the cross

Wash away us all

Then throughout the night, they were raped and executed
Cold hearted world
Your language unheard of
The vast sound of tuning out
The rash of negativity is seen one sidedly
Burn away the day
The nervous, the drifting, the heaving

Cold hearted world

Extinguishing the sun

sweat, heat and profane debate
the smart ones stay on the outside

centered man swings a punch,
spits a tooth, postures odd
a punk rock escapade
five bucks a head to be king dick in the crowd

We are the ones who must sport the position

cheap beer
trendy clicks
lesbian love is accepted and right
shaved heads meet hair in the mix

Ringworm, crabs and lice
V.D. ecstasy, speed and horse

an honor of sex to be stuck by the punk

Rich homes with money and food
abandoned for the bums on the street

don't try and save what is all meant to be

Crucified for no sins
No revenge beneath me
Lost within my plans for life
It all seems so unreal

Left in my misery

Without a tear in his eyes
Nothing new for him to see

I will remember
The love our souls had sworn to make
Now I watch the falling rain
All my mind can see now is your

Well I guess you took my youth
And gave it all away
Like the birth of a new found joy
This love would end in rage
And when she died, I couldn't cry
The pride within my soul
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories now unfold

Believe the word
I will unlock my door
And pass the cemetery gates

Sometimes when I'm alone
I wonder aloud
If you're watching over me
Some place far abound
I must reverse my life
I can't live in the past
Then set my soul free
Belong to me at last

Through all those complex years
I thought I was alone
I didn't care to look around
And make this world my wound
And when she died
I should've cried
And spared myself some pain...
You left me incomplete
All alone as the memories still remain

The chance to save my soul
And my concern is now in vain

Still you'd turn away, now as I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name

All these years I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head, raise your face, your eyes
Tell me who you think you are

I walk, I walk alone into the promised land
There's a better place for me but it's far, far away
Everlasting life for me in a perfect world
But I gotta die first, please God, send me on my way

Time has a way of taking time
The loneliness is not only felt by fools
Alone I call to ease the pain
To be held by you alone, so alone, I'm lost
Consumed by the pain, the pain, the pain, the pain

Enraged my mind starts to smoke

Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture it's jaws to let me be
A cut out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stops to stare

Enraged my mind starts to smoke

Dirt grits beneath my feet, the stair creaks

Sit in granny's rockin' chair

Funny thing, he's like you and me

Rise so high, yet so far to fall
A plan of dignity and balance for all
Political breakthrough, euphoria's high
More borrowed money, more borrowed time

Backed in a corner, caught up in the race
Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal Holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Nature's scales are forced to tip

The heartland cries, loss of all pride
To leave ain't believing, so try and be tried
Insufficient funds, insanity and suicide

Foreclosure of a dream
Those visions never seen
Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

The congress will push me to raise the taxes
And I'll say, "No, read my lips"
Read my lips, read my lips

Now with new hope some will be proud
This is no hoax, no one pushed out
Receive a reprieve and be a pioneer
Break new ground of a new frontier

New ideas will surely get by
No deed, or dividend, some may ask, "Why?"
You'll find the solution, the answers in the sky

And the soldiers liberate them, laying mines along their roads
Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall

Pass it to the left, and collect your mighty kill

When you said that you knew
You just can't believe
No, there's nothing to say
I was almost honest, almost

Living alone, can't stand this place
It's four in the morning and I still see your face

I was nearly pure
When I said, I loved you
You were semi-sincere
You said "I'd bleed for you"
We were kind of candid
Now you've gone away
I was almost honest, almost

Living alone, I'm falling from grace
I want to be alone but there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not turning back
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks

I question your call by the tone of your voice
I know I should hang up but I don't have a choice
It happened that night when you told me to go
Don't ask who's to blame, I don't know

Living alone, falling from grace
I want to, don't, but there's just empty space
I can't face tomorrow, now you're not coming back
Walked off in the night and just left me the tracks

Almost, almost honest
Almost, almost honest

Almost, I was almost honest

You're such a pretty face, radiant
I saw you across the room, I knew I had to have you
Thus started the chase, I knew I would do anything
To take your hand and make you mine

But I learnt long ago if you love someone
You have to let it go, let it go, let it go
The hardest part of letting go
Is saying goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

You severed away in a makeshift cell
Beneath the venomous moonlight
Why unleash my plan to watch you fail?
And why I am so afraid?

Go to sleep, my love
And taste my sweet revenge on your lips
Sealed with a kiss

I returned to the masquerade ball
I kneel the most if you're weeping
Stone by stone immured in the walls
Forever left for safe keeping

Go to sleep, my love
And taste my sweet revenge upon your lips
Sealed with a kiss

But I learnt long ago if you love someone
You have to let it go, let it go, let it go
The hardest part of letting go

I hope the end is less painful, than my life
I stand on trial before the Gods on Judgment Day
A blink of an eye between the cradle and the grave

Soaring to the sun with blood upon their wings
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind

Set The World Afire
Red flash clouds choking out the morning sky
They said it'd never come, we knew it was a lie
All forms of life die now the humans all succumb
Time to kiss your ass goodbye the end has just begun

Distorted figures walk the street, it's 1989 [s: 1999]
Weeds once underneath your feet have grown into vines
Bodies melted like a candle, a land without a face
No time to change your fate, no time left, it's too late

The arsenal of Megadeth can't be rid they said
And if it comes, the living will envy the dead
Racing for power, and all come in last
No winning first stone cast
This falsehood worldly peace
It's treaties will soon cease
No one will be left to prove that numbers existed
Maybe soon the children will be born open fisted
We all live on one planet it will all go up in smoke

Too bad they couldn't see this lethal energy
and now the final scene, a global darkening

Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruins
Towering overhead both far and wide
There's unknown tools of World War III

It was a cool winter's morning
A wink shortly past 9 a.m.
The only car they wanted for the heist wasn't coming
So instead they went for the bank

The fateful duo that sat in the getaway car
The police sedated with thousands of miles
Armor piercing for the automatic weapons
The police arrived, torn out on the ground

Baptized in a firefight
Hot blood running cold as ice
44 minutes of target practice
All hell is breaking loose

Out gunned, watching the porch
Drawn to a firefight with a pocketknife
It was cool until they saw an Achilles Heel
And it brought down the beast

This was an accident waiting to happen
It wasn't if it was happening, it was when
The city's people sabotaged themselves
Caught in the firepower and the expense

The two most violent men it seemed couldn't be stopped
Standard police issued guns were just not enough
But SWAT arrived to settle the fight
Between AK-47 and AR-15

Baptized in a firefight
Hot blood running cold as ice
44 minutes of target practice
All hell is breaking loose

Out gunned, watching the porch
Drawn to a firefight with a pocketknife

And all that drives me on
Till all is gone except
The simple plans of mice and men

Back when I was just seventeen
I thought that I knew everything
I could make it in this scene
To be a risin' star that only gleamed
When all the answers disagreed
With the questions held for me

I was legal now at twenty-one
I knew the way the world should run
My God, just look what I had done
Simply drunk and havin' fun
Looked for friends but I found none
All alone at twenty-one

The fire burns on
And all that drives me on
Till all is gone except
The simple plans of mice and men

At twenty-five I was surprised
That I was even half alive
Somehow I managed to survive
I felt my body's doin' time
In my back a hundred knives
All from my friends at twenty-five

And now as Gabriel sounds my warning bell
I'd buy your life if you'd sell
And you would too if less compelled
So live your life and live it well
Theres not much left of me to tell
I just got back up each time I fell

Conspiracy of silence

Raised in a form of living hell

There's so many fighting to get past the pearly gates
But nobody ever wants to die or get saved
Their intentions aren't that good and I can smell the asphalt
That's their personal road to hell being paved

And when we walk down the street
The wind sings our names in rebel songs
And it's much too late when the fear is gone

Where were you when it happened?
Where could you be found?
Were you at the front of the stage
Or in the underground?

From S.F out to Old Brit
New York to L.A
The world of metal changed forever
Back in the day

Well that was back in the day
And if you weren't there
It doesn't matter anyway
Because you wouldn't understand

Live to die, die to play
Every day and place
Leave a path of metal across
A world from stage to stage

Well, that was back in the day
And if you weren't there
It doesn't matter anyway
Because you wouldn't understand

In denim and leather
We were a one for all all for one force
Knocked rock 'n' roll on it's ass
And put metal on the course

Thrash, thrash, thrash, thrash

Back in the day
If you weren't there
It doesn't matter
'Cause you wouldn't understand

This is our way of life
A life that was born free
To follow orders how to live
Was never meant to be

Ah ah oh oh oh

Hints of thunder, seeds of lightning
The power hits the stage
The music was exciting
The mania raged

Ah ah oh oh oh

We all had a fever
Our ears started to ring
Feeding this wildfire
Consuming everything

Ah ah oh oh oh

Metal's king back then
And still is to this day
Others imitate or challenge
But it never goes away

Angel in our pocket, devil by our side
We ain't goin' nowhere cuz' heroes never die

No shame and guilt, there's nothing there

As I shoot my venom in
You pretend you didn't know

There's nothing else, there's never been
And I dream, to be left alone
With the sadness, the madness of my own

Oh, so pernicious
Her soul it creates song

Labled to terminate our

Is walking next to me
To the stake, my last request
To have her burn with me

Rain began to fall

Was spread before you all

Old, weak, and feeble

To stay away from evil

Swinging the hammer, I hack through their heads,
Deviant defilers, you're next to be dead.
I unleash my hammer with sadistic intent.
Pounding, surrounding, slamming through your head. Yeah!

Their bodies convulse, in agony, and, pain.
I mangle their faces, till no features remain.
A blade for the butchering, I cut them to shreds.
First take out the organs, then cut off the head.
The remains of flesh now sop under my feet.
One more bloody massacre, the murders' complete.
I seek to dismember, a sadist fiend.
And, blood baths are my way of getting clean.
I lurk in the alleys, wait for the kill.

Invading their dreams before the day even starts

Looking down the cross bleeding from the crown
Led to stay to die beside the thieves

You give up on yourself
Somehow you got betrayed again
Thin ice and luck runs out
Who will you blame it on this time?

And due to a lack of interest in you
The light at the end of the tunnel was turned off
And something I've noticed
Beating you is thrilling me, I've got a secret for you

If you took your own direction
If only you practice what you preach
If you follow your advice
You wouldn't be burning bridges all the time

Don't close your eyes to injustice
Listen, being brave ain't chicken shit
A man without any valor
Has nothing worth living for

The tides of change pulled us apart
I feel a familiar pain
It seems like years since we've loved
Or even liked and that's a lonely way to be

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right, did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I will never take you back

You know what? It's over
I just don't feel the same way as I used to
We've been together forever
But it's over, it's over, it's over

Goodbye, 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye

Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love, 1000 times goodbye

It seems nothing good is free
A good thing cost much more than the price
You were good but not that good
Don't kid yourself, now it's time to break up

Drifting alone in a sea of agony
Your face I can't recognize
Don't make this hard on us
I will miss you if you just go away

I did no right, you did no wrong
Nothing left but wasted days
I regret you leaving
But I'll never take you back

Don't call me anymore, it's just not
I don't feel the same about you
It's not as good as it used to be
Used to be, used to be

Goodbye, 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind
That this would be my last goodbye

Let me put pennies on your eyes
And kiss your lips one last goodbye
My love, 1000 times goodbye

Goodbye, 1000 times goodbye
The thought never crossed my mind

Let me put pennies on your eyes

I'll always love you
But just not like that
Like what?
I wanna be honest with you
I met someone else
You did what?

And I really, I really love him
Like I used to love you
Remember the time that I told you
That I was going out of town for business?
Well, I went to see him
You know what? You suck!

Goodbye 1000 times

You'll always have
A special place in my heart
You know that
It's just, I can't be with you anymore
It's over

Goodbye 1000 times
Things may not work out with him
Goodbye 1000 times
And if they don't
Goodbye 1000 times
Then I'll certainly call you
Goodbye 1000 times

You mean a lot to me
I still really want to be friends with you
I love you like you're my brother

Mountains on the ground

Her flowers all have died

A burning candle in-between and at both ends
With all that we've learned, yet we still pretend
I just wish you could say my name again

The vaccine wipes your memories,

A tangled web they weave, when they practice to deceive

So, now the time has come to say the long goodbye

Day after day after day the world will pass you by
I said that I'd be strong, but you know I had to lie

You forget to remember... it's time to say the long goodbye

Dark clouds on the horizon

A walking mistake but every time I run away
I just come back for more

And fall on my sword or light a fire
To see who runs or stays
And plays the confidence game

The truth taunts me
That nobody wants me

I watch it spin there

Then you'll sleep with the fishes

Sleepwalker did I tell you I was in movies?
Then dump you garroted lying naked in a ditch
Sleepwalker everyday, another way
I know you can hear me

I think you'd look nice in a Colombian necktie
Should stop your tongue from wagging the dog
No more stupidity from you as I pull your tongue through
For a smile from ear to ear, now there's nothing to hear

No one is safe
When I close my eyes
I come to take your life

And then I wake up
And it was all just a dream
And everything is still the same

Sleepwalker did I give you concrete shoes?
And throw your body off of a bridge
Sleepwalker when I lay down to sleep
Pray your soul is mine to keep, I feel you near me

Take a simple fateful turn
Opened up to stop the bleeding

Feeling you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein and struck a nerve

In your darkest hour, you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all

Just another lesson learned...

Just another brick you toss
Stone the number one deceiver
Multiply the added cost
Easy to become a believer

I mending fence along the road
Barely holding together
Mapless zone the road signs holes
Keep ahead of the weather
Long past time to close dead eyes
Find a break in the highway
Out here I'm invisible
Very few going my way

Breath on a window showing tic tac toe
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home

Ghost town strip of misery
I ain't feeling no better
Road kill heart inside of me
Follow it to the letter
Sundown brings a welcome change
Everything that's hiding
More at home in landscapes strange
Are you selling I'm buying

Breath on a window showing tic tac toe
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home
Cigarette burn holes outline an old soul
Connect the dot scribbling
And you would never know

Failed to heed the signal
Thought you got through just in time
Crashing hard upon your ego
Penetrated from the side

I'd let you go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday

I'd love to go, but you're always in the way

Call off the chase

Walls of thought, strong and high
As my castle crumbles with time

Such a crime

You opened fire
And your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smilin' skull at you
You opened fire

I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow

Lines cut across my face
Why you laugh at my disgrace

Road narrows, pouring down
I'm breaking without a sound
Bits and pieces of trying
Get what you pay for, nothing

Frozen dreaming of yesterday
Potent, creeping I'm far away
From my hometown I lit out
To save my skin and shed some doubt

I know how false the floor
How high the sky
Been down that road before

It's a lie, you hide in someone else
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself

Hard as truth is, been my friend
Don't need to be invited in

Pick up myself and try again

Been down that road before

Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can see the end is getting near
I won't rest until my head is clear
Ahh, what's the difference? I'll die
Ahh, in this sick world of mine

Can you see the end?
Choke on me, my friend
Must to drown these thoughts
Purity over rot, ah, ah, ah

Yeah, what the hell am I
Worn eroded pride
Saddened 10 miles wide
I'm gonna let it slide

Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can feel the wheel but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear
Ahh, what's the difference? I'll die

Itching and nibbling for a small piece of sanity
Of which you can not give, shit

Buying pennies with my soul

Cuts From The Crypt
MONSTER MASH
Good evening!

I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
My monster, from its slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

He did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash, and it's a graveyard smash
He did the Mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the Mash, he did the Monster Mash

From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom, where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

They did the Mash, they did the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the Mash, they caught on in a flash
They did the Mash, they did the Monster Mash

The zombies were having fun
The party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman
Dracula, and his son

The scene was rocking, all were digging the sound
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The Coffin Bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, The Crypt Keeper Five

They did the Mash, they played the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the Mash, they caught on in a flash
They played the Mash, they played the Monster Mash

Out of his coffin his voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
Opened the lid, shook his fist, and said
"Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?"

It's now the Mash, it's now the Monster Mash
The Monster Mash, and it's a graveyard smash
It's now the Mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the Mash, it's now the Monster Mash

Now everything is cool, Drac's a part of the band
My Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living, this Mash was meant, too
When you get to my door, tell them Only sent you

Then you can Mash, then you can Monster Mash
The Monster Mash, another graveyard smash
Then you can Mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can Mash, you did the Monster Mash

The Monster Mash...

Saturday Night
There's 52 ways to murder anyone
One and two are the same
And they both work as well

I'm coming clean for Amy
Julie doesn't scream as well
And the cops won't listen all night

And so maybe I'll be over
Just as soon as I fill them all in

And I can't remember when I saw her last
We were running around and having a blast
But the backseat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home

I was thinking about you
There was something I forgot to say
I was crying on a Saturday Night

I was out cruising without you
They were playing our song
Crying on a Saturday Night

As the moon becomes the night time
You go viciously, quietly away
I'm sitting in the bedroom where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes
Now I'm watching
Watching you die

Rip the veins from human necks, until they're wet with life

Upon our radar’s eye
Four armored birds will soon engage
Something unidentified

Evasively it turns on them

Vanishing without a trace

Is the last thing they will say

Lost at sea a mighty fleet
Sends an S.O.S. in code
50 years it reappears
Coffee isn’t even cold

Returning from its nowhere
The crew was never found
Their spirits haunt these ghost ships
And they make such eerie sounds

Far beyond the waves

Left his son for a moment
Returned, found him dead

Recalls a tale as a boy he was told
Of an evil witch, so wicked, so old
Seeks a farmers advice he will not give
His oldest son knows just where the witch lived

He took Ed there but refused to go in
They boy knew what was about to begin
She had the power to avenge the dead
It cost your sould, now come with me Ed

I'm gonna take you where your body will lie
I'm gonna take you there, my friend
I'm gonna show you where your life will end
I'm gonna bring you here again

Dig up your grave, the old lady said
The thing we need lies here dormant, sleeping with the dead
You understand what you ask of me
Not even death can set your soul free

I cast this curse and you will find
An evil darkness deep inside your vengeful mind
God damn you to hell, he could not restrain
He already has son, the witch did explain

I'm gonna take you where your body will lie

They could teach our race

But yet on Mars, a darker side
Like all things that God made
Their tribe of war, would heed them not
"Earth they must invade"

See: the fire in the skies
See: them devastate the land
Mars attacks: the warlord chief commands

See: the humans fight and die
See: our planet laid to waste
Mars attacks: monsters invade the earth from space

It was then, in our darkest hour
When everything seemed lost
The hearts of men would not concede
No matter what the cost

They forged a sword of sound and steel
Upon the Martian doors
The voice of war would thunder there
And "Mars would be no more"

See: the Martian cities fall
See: the death of the warrior tribe
Mars attacks, now their planet won't survive

See: their world turn into ash
See: the terror on their face
Mars explodes, cast out as rubble into space

Years ago they took from me
The only thing I ever loved
For I've returned, hear me say
There's nowhere to run

Vengeance is mine, snap of your spine
Tracking, the wolf's at your throat

Succulently, the beast so silent feeding
Into Hell you go speeding

By the moon crypt doors open
Every last bone was broken
Murder without a clue
For Dr. Phibes rises again

Oh, my wife again you'll live
The gift of life be mine to give
First there's things that I must do
Make them pay for killing you

My patients, my prey, all flesh torn away
Nurse scalpel please, skinned to the bone
Killed on the phone, what a shame, no one home

Succulently, the beast so silent feeding
Into Hell you go speeding

By the moon crypt doors open
Killed before one word's spoken
Murder without a clue

Once upon life will give her
And there we'll ride, oh

And we can be together again, yeah

As we sit on the river
Breath of life make me shiver
Open your eyes my dear

Can you help me, occupy my brain? 
Oh, yeah... 

I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find. 
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind... 

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry.

Or if he moves will he fall?

Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
Where he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfold

Now the time is here
For iron man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave

Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's heaven and hell, oh well

The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, heaven and hell
I can tell, fool, fool!

Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on....

They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh no!
Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Fool, fool!
Look for the answer!

Revolution in their minds - the children start to march
Against the world in which they have to live
And all the hate that's in their hearts
They're tired of being pushed around
And told just what to do
They'll fight the world until they've won
And love comes flowing through

Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bringing peace in any way?
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear?

So you children of the world,

Show the world that love is still alive
You must be brave

i feel unhappy
I feel so sad
I lost the best friend
That i ever had

She was my woman
I loved her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

We shared the years
We shared each day
In love together
We found a way

But soon the world
Had its evil way
My heart was blinded
Love went astray

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

It took so long
To realize

You've seen life through distorted eyes
You know you had to learn
The execution of your mind
You really had to turn
The race is run the book is read
The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don't want to know

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you
You want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you
And now there's just no return
You're wishing that the hands of doom
Could take your mind away
And you don't care if you don't see again
The light of day

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
Fill your head all full of lies

Where can you run to
What more can you do
No more tomorrow
Life is killing you
Dreams turn to nightmares
Heaven turns to hell
Burned out confusion
Nothing more to tell

Everything around you
What's it coming to
God knows as your dog knows
Bog blast all of you

Fairy boots were dancin' with a dwarf, all right now!

So drop the acid pill, don't stop to think now

You're having a good time baby
But that won't last

You're living too fast
go out enjoy yourself
Don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you
To stick the needle in, yeah

Now you know the scene, your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer seeing life's reality
Push the needle in, face death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin

Could it be the end of man and time
Back on earth the flame of life burns low
Everywhere is misery and woe
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
Man prepares to meet his destiny

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the night sky so vast
Burning metal through the atmosphere
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
With the hateful battles raging on
rockets flying to the glowing sun
Through the empires of eternal void
Freedom from the final suicide

Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
escape from brainwashed minds and pollution.
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
find another world where freedom waits.
Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
where the sons of freedom make their home

Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves

Was it wise, to disguise
How I tried to get away from you now
Is there a way, that I can pay
Or is it true I have to stay with you now

Can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead
You just stay in your grave

Is God just a thought within your head
Or is He a part of you?
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book
When you were in school?

When you think about death
Do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the pope
On the end of a rope, do you think he's a fool?

Well, I have seen the truth, yes, I've seen the light
And I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared
At the end of our days

Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realize before they criticize
That God is the only way to love

Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run?
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say that you may as well worship the sun?

I think it was true
It was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad
The opinion you had was the only one voiced

Will you be so sure when your day is near
Say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down
Now you can't retrieve

Perhaps you'll think before you say
That God is dead and gone
Open your eyes
Just realize that He's the one

The only One who can save you
Now from all this sin and hate
Or will you still jeer at all you hear?

The unborn child that never was conceived

When little worlds collide

Are cast into the never ending well
The name that scorns the face
The child that never sees the cause of man
The deathly darkness that
Belies the fate of those who never ran

To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on

Love has given life to you
And now it's your concern
Unseen eyes of inner life
Will make your soul return
Still I look but not to touch
The seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls
The secret stays unknown

Just remember love is life
And hate is living death
Treat your life for what it's worth
And live for every breath

Looking for the answers that they know inside
Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme
Snow White's mirror said "partners in crime!"

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry
Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold back, `till it's ready, taking it slow

Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again

Don't you ever say die
Don't you ever say die
Never say die

Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall
Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, throwing us a die
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine

There's no need to have a reason
There's no need to wonder why

I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by

The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone

I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong

You never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another man

You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now, I've got to know you
Tell me who am I to blame?

I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong

Now the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part

Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known

I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong

Now the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart

And watch you slowly take away

Your back's to the wall
Chain the sun, and it tears away to face you as you run
You run, you run

Behind the smile, there's danger and a promise to be told:
You'll never get old - ha!
Life's fantasy - to be locked away and still to think you're free,
You're free, we're free

So live for today, but tomorrow never comes

Die young, die young
Can't you see the writing in the end?
Die young, gonna die young

Just to you

What kind of people do you think we are?
Another joker who's a rock and roll star for you
Just for you

The faithful image of another man
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you
Yeah for you

The shot troopers laying down on the floor
I wish they'd put an end to my running war with you
Yeah with you

Are you metal, are you man?
You've changed in life since you began
Yeah began

Ladies digging gold from you
Will they still dig now you're through
Yeah you're through

You bought and sold me with your lying words
The voices in the deck that you never heard came through
Yeah came through

Your folly finally got to spend with a gun
A poisoned father who has poisoned his son, that's you
Yeah that's you

I beg you please don't let it get any worse
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you
Yeah curse you

All of the promises that never came true
You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true
Ah, that's true

Are you Satan, are you man?
You've changed in life since it began
It began

Vultures sucking gold from you
Will they still suck now you're through

The search is on so you just better run,
and find yourself another way.
Rob the dead, they don't feel a thing, 
and keep you living for another day

(Rats, Rat)

You are nonentity, you have no destiny
You are a victim of a thing unknown
A mantle picture of a stolen soul
A fornication of your golden throne

A smiling face, it means the world to me
So tired of sadness and of misery

My life it started, some time ago,
where it stands, I don't know.
I thought I was so good, I thought I was fine.
I feel my world being torn apart

But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind

I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know
Listen to me while I sing this song

Too many people advising me
But they don't know what my eyes see

Walpurgis (Original Version Of War Pigs)
Witches gather at black masses 
Bodies burning in red ashes 
On the hill the church in ruin. 
Is the scene of evil doings 
It's a place for all bad sinners 
Watch them eating dead rats' innards. 
I guess it's the same, where ever you may go 
Oh lord yeah 

Carry banners which denounce the lord 
See me rocking in my grave 
See them anoint my head with dead rat's blood 
See them stick the stake through me
Oh

Don't hold me back cause I just gotta go 
They've got a hold of my soul now
Lords got my brain instinct with blood obscene 
Look in my eyes I'm there enough 
Yeah 

On the scene a priest appears 
Sinners falling at his knees 
Satan sends out funeral pyre 
Casts the priest into the fire 
It's the place for all bad sinners.

Well i don't want no demon to tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me to get my soul out
Don't believe in violence, i don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door and my mind has been released

Well i don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No i don't want no one to tell me where i'm gonna go when i die
I wanna live my life with no people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true

Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruin me
And i can't seem to eliminate them

People riding their real pace
Keep on running their rat race
The ante is risen once a week
In their world of make-believe

So believe what i tell you, it's the only way to fight in the end

It's complete but obsolete
All tomorrow's become yesterday
In demand but second hand
It's been heard before you even play

Up to date but came too late
Better get yourself another name
You're so right but overnight
You're the one who has to take the blame

Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried

Don't delay you're in today
But tomorrow is another dream
Sunday's star is Monday's scar
Out of date before you're even seen

At the top so quick to flop
You're so new but rotting in decay
Like butterfly so quick to die
But you're only looking for today

Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried
Looking for today

Glamour trip so soon to slip
Easy come but oh how quick it goes
Ten foot tall but what to fall
Hard to open yet so easy to close
Front page news but so abused
You just want to hide yourself away
Over-paid, but soon you fade
Because you're only looking for today
Looking for today

So you think you know what's going on inside her head
You think she wants your money but it's you she wants instead

When you think about the things that she did long ago
It breaks your heart but deep down boy you don't want her to go

You feel your love's so shattering you feel you want to die
Just because the one mistake of telling you a lie

If I were you I'd try again and try to make amends
She only thinks of you, you know I'm talking as a friend

As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At the tapestries all faded
Their vague and distant glories
Concealed in the gloom
The icy fingers of forgotten passions
Softly brushing my lips
At the tips of my primitive soul

As you look through my door
Deep into my room
Can you feel the mighty wall of power?
It's waiting, waiting in the gloom
The distant shadows of forgotten champions
Those who live in me still
And will rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again
Born

Look at this prince of evil
Fighting for your mind
Fighting all the priests of shame
For the thrust of my challenge is aimed
At the hearts of mutant Gods
Who think we're all the same
They're controlling our minds
And they use us for fortune and fame

As you look through my window
Deep into my room
At your future and freedom
The gray and plastic retards all floating in circles
And as you taste the fruits of new sensations
Softly brushing your lips
As we rise when we challenge and kill

Born again
You'll be born again
Born
Born again
You'll be born again

If you want to be a king for a day
Just do what I say

Born again
You'll be born again

Everybody's got to think like a hunter
Just search for your prey

Born again
You'll be born again
Born

Be alive through the night and the day
Just do it my way

Falling Off The Edge Of The World
I think about closing the door
and lately I think of it more
I'm living well out of my time
I feel like i'm losing my mind

I should be at the table round
a servant of the crown
the keeper of the sign
to sparkle and to shine

Never, no never again!
listen to me and believe what I say if you can
Never, this is the end
you know I've seen the faces of doom and I'm only a man
Help me, tell me I'm sane
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain
Save me, take me away
you know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!

I've got to be strong
oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world
think you're safe, but you're wrong!
We are falling off the edge of the world!

Look out! there's danger! no where to run!
It seems like desperate measures but sometimes it has to be done
Over, it's over at last
There's a message inside as we build a new life from the past

We're falling off the edge of the world!
Yes, the edge of the world!

Locked in cages, a prisoner

Ride together, don't try it

But the knife can't cut the hero down

Giving nothing, the taker
The maker of war

Be stronger than me

Where they say the wind won't blow
And they only speak in whispers of a name
There's a lady they say who feeds the darkness
It eats right from her hand
With a crying shout she'll search you out
And freeze you where you stand

Lady evil, evil
She's a magical, mystical woman
Lady evil, evil in my mind
She's queen of the night
All right!

In a place just south of witches' valley
Where they say the rain won't fall
Thunder cracks the sky, it makes you bleed
There's a lady they say who needs the darkness
She can't face the light
With an awful shout, she'll find you out
And have you before the night

Lady evil, evil

Long ago i wandered through my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness i had no fears
Innocence and love was all i knew
Was it illusion?

Soon the days went passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was more than fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
Was it illusion?

Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through furnace of tears
Eyes full of angered illusion
Hiding in every ???

Somehow must reflect the truth we feel
Fade away, fade away

If an echo doesn't answer
When it hears a searchin' sound
Then the beast is free to wander
But never seen around

Headless Cross
Look through the people, and on through the mist
to the hill of the headless cross
Where all witches meet, on a night such as this
and the power of darkness is host
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul
with and Angel that fell from the sky
Borne on the air, the screams and the wails
of the masses appointed to die

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's been no escape from the power of Satan
on a nation so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross

How do you feel, when the locks refuse the key
and the master is calling your name
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm?
does the talisman protect you from pain?

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light 
cut the crucifix half to the ground 
There's no escaping the power of Satan 
on a nation so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder 
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture, oh no, oh 
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross
At the Headless Cross, oh, at the Headless Cross
Where will you run to?
At the Headless Cross
Look, to the Headless Cross

Johnny Blade
============

Tortured and twisted, he walks the streets alone
People avoid him, they know the street's his own
Cold blade of silver, his eyes they burn so wild
Mean as a tiger, society's own child

Go the tiger, burn in hate
You know you have to, Johnny Blade
He's the meanest guy around his town
One look and he will cut you down
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade

Life has no meaning, and Death's his only friend
Will fate surprise him, where will he meet his end?
He feels so bitter, yes he's so full of hate
To die in the gutter, I guess that's Johnny's fate

Rivals all across the land
He kills them with his knife in hand
He's the meanest guy around his town
One look and he will cut you down
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade

Well you know that Johnny's a spider
And his web is the city at night
He's a victim of modern frustration
That's the reason he's so ready to fight

He's the one that should be afraid
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?

Oh he knows his future's decided
And he ain't gonna change it, no way
He was born to die in the gutter
He'll keep fighting `till the end of his days

Been alone all through his life
His only friend is a switchblade knife
He's the one who should be afraid
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?

You fool the people
Who's fooling who?
It's time to listen
Who's fool are you?

Turn Up The Night
A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
You know what to cover, I think for another it's a story told
So get a good hold, yeah

Regiment fooled you, you thought that you knew who you are
A simple equation, that's the relation, but that's gone too far
A time of suspicion, a special condition that we all know
So let it all go!

Turn up the night!
Turn up the night!
Turn up the night, it feels so right!

Nighttitme sorrow, taken like a pain
Black will not become a white, it's all the same
Evil lurks in twilight, dances in the dark
Makes you need the movement, like a fire needs a spark to burn!

A rumble of thunder, I'm suddenly under your spell
No rhyme or reason, or time of the season, but oh well
The darkened deliver, I shake and I shiver down your soul
So get a good hold, yeah

War Pigs (Walpurgis Lyrics)
witches gather at black masses
bodies burning in red ashes
on the hill the church in ruins
is the scene of evil doings
it's the place for all black sinners
watch them eating dead rat's innerds
i guess its the same
wherever u may go
oh lord yea

carry banners which denounce the lord
see me rocking in my grave
see them anoint my head with dead rat's blood
see them stick this stake through me

lord hold me back _____ gotta go
they gotta hold my soul down
lord can my brain escape what blood im seeing
lord can my eyes bare it all
yea

on the scene a priest appears
sinners falling at his knees
satan sends out funeral pyer
casts the priest into the fire
it's the place for all bad sinners
watch them eating dead rat's innerds
i guess its the same
wherever u may go
oh lord yea

Rising with the sun, the work has been done
But people are starting to stare
Called from afar to the court of the Czar
Could it be something is wrong?

You stand face to face and your heart gathers pace
For the answer to a question a prize
If only you had known to be honest was wrong
For the work that you've done you, it will pay with your eyes

Don't be afraid to an [Incomprehensible]

Into the black where the night never ends
And the light leaves a scar on your soul
Where your heart used to hold your love here
Heaven in black

Inside there's a voice saying was there a choice?
You'd still be entombed in the night
Lucifer's to blame, the reason for the flame
They've taken your sight but they'll not take your God

Don't be afraid to an [Incomprehensible]

Into the black where the night never ends
And the light leaves a scar on your soul
Where your heart used to hold your love here

Behind The Wall Of Sleep/Wasp

Precious cups within the flower
deadly petals with strange power
faces shine a deadly smile
back up on you at your trial

Chill and numbs from head to toe
icy sun with frosty glow
Why'd you go reaching your sorrow?
why'd you go read no tomorrow

Feel your spirit rise with the priest
feel your body falling to its knees
Take your walk of remorse
take your body to a corpse
take your body to a corpse
take your body to a corpse
if you want all remorse
take your body to a corpse

Now from darkness, there springs light
Wall of Sleep is cold and bright
Wall of Sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you are awoken

Country Girl
Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah

We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending 
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air

In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars,
the endless search for where you are
(sail on, sail on)

Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul 
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!

Don't sail away on a crimson tide!
Don't leave your heart on the other side!

Don't ever fall in love!
Don't give your heart away!

Let's try getting to the sky, hang on or you're going to die
Sour life can turn sweet, it's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries, keep looking at the eyes

Good life is contradiction
Because of crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I will take your soul and plant my seed

You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal, unreal

You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up the stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers send electric lies, lies

We're disturbing the Priest
Won't you please come to our feast?
Do we mind disturbing the Priest
Not at all, not at all, not in the least
Aah, do we mind disturbing the Priest
Aah, not at all, not at all, not in the least

The force of the devil is the darkness the Priest has to face
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set alight
The flames of doubt so deep inside, inside

The devil and the Priest can't exist if one goes away
It's just like the battle of the sun and the moon and night and day
The force of the devil, that's we're all told to fear
Watch out for religion when he gets too near, too near

We're disturbing the Priest
Won't you please come to our feast?
Do we mind disturbing the priest
Not at all, not at all, not in the least

Good life is contradiction
Because of crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need
I'll take your soul and plant my seed

Let's try getting to the sky, hang on or you're gonna die
Sour life can turn sweet, it's laying' at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while
Hey, when he cries, keep lookin' at the eyes

She sits in silence, in her midnight world
Her faded pictures, of her dancing girls
Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind

In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away

And as the seasons turn the days to years
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen
And now she dances only in her dreams

In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away

It really was a meeting
The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car

And I was going down the track
About a hundred and five
They had the stopwatch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of Tequila and I felt real good
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went off exploring

I knew I wouldn't make it
The car just wouldn't make it
I was turning, the tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Greenfly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring, I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
At the canal turn, I hit an oily patch
Inebriation

I knew I wouldn't make it
The car just wouldn't make it
I was turning, the tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

Ooh, Mr Miracle, you saved me from some pain
I thank you, Mr Miracle, I won't get trashed again
Ooh, can you hear my lies?
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes?

I was turning, the tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye

Ooh, Mr Miracle, you saved me from some pain
I thank you, Mr Miracle, I won't get trashed again
Ooh, can you hear my lies?
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes?

We went to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains
'Cause there was no tequila
As we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we got trashed, we were laughing still
Oh bless my soul

Fire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein
Worlds possession, endless tears
Truth and knowledge stolen all their years

World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence stills the air and kills the chime
Words are poison, passion bleeds
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds

The time of dreams has turned
The night is gone and light shines on
Where darkness once would hide
With spirits high, our fears were born

Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you
Keep you from a restless heart, oh, oh
Deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs within you
The reason for the restless heart, oh, oh
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones

Fire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein
World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence stills the air and kills the chime

Can faith destroy desire? Each breath a prayer
Each step brings fear
The eyes of they that see have evil stare
Watch over me

Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you
Keep you from a restless heart oh, oh
Deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs within you
The reason for the restless heart, oh, oh
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones
He's the keeper of the Sabbath Stones

What God is this that stands to hear his people cry?
What hand would strike and watch his people die?

I'm just another back street kid
Rock 'n Roll music is the only thing I really dig
Can't stop the music going round inside my head
I'm a rock 'n roll soldier,gonna play it until I'm dead
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me

Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine
Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been
Playing my music,sitting in my hotel room
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me

Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going
Got to see yourself in other's eye's,surprised?
Living like I want to don't come easy,but I'm trying
Sorting out what's true and what are lies,it's wise

Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land
Seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands
So listen to the music,want to see you get so high
'Cos I'm a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me

There's no reason for you to run
You can't escape the fate of the chosen one
Black moon rising, in a blood red sky
This time you realise that you're gonna die

Drinking your blood brew is your answer
That's what you plan to do
No dreaming, time you cheat this master
You're on your own going through

Wind of mist has taken over your mind
And you think you're on your own
Don't believe you are the only one here
Look around, you're not alone

Feel the forces from another world
Ghostly shadows fill your mind
Evil power hanging over you
As you freeze, you're like a child
Look behind you!

Somebody's calling
Someone is near
Feel yourself falling
Falling with fear
You tell yourself you're dreaming
You realise you're screaming
You know that this shouldn't happen to you
You tell yourself that it's scary too
But there is nothing you can do, oh!

Ghostly shadows from the other world
Evil forces in your mind
Trapped between the worlds of life and death
Frozen in the realms of time
Look behind you!

You feel yourself falling, you're at the end of the line
Your body is crawling, but your senses are blind
Cold, cold feelings are running through your brains
Ice cold fingers, running through your veins

Since he was elected,adrenalin injected
Hear him saying all moving parts should kill
Just like the hero he's got them all on the run,
yes he's won

Since he passed the motion
They're building in the ocean
And he's saying all men should be free
What a combination,peace and radiation
And he's saying free men should fight for me
Just like his momma,he seems to get his pleasure from pain,
And the rain,ain't that strange? Very strange

I like choking toys
You've got to see me before you meet the boys
Teacher's burnt the school,
He's had enough of sticking to the rules
People stop and see
he's got to be more decadent than me
Just to pass the time
He gets his kicks from licking off the wine

Pretty silly ladies
All Cynthia'd and Sadie's

It's against my uniform
To be a civil judge
All the songs are history now
`Bout rock stars and their grudge
Let us cast our minds back
To thirty years or more
You took up all the vandals
Will Hitler beat `em all?

And we're sad and sorry
Really sorry that it happened that way
Yes we're sad and sorry
But why'd you have to treat us that way?

Compare ourselves with others
And cover them in sin
Oh, God what a terrible
A terrible state we're in
There must be some way out of here
A comprimise that's right
If we cannot work it out
We're gonna have to fight

Yes we're sad and sorry
Really sorry that it happened that way
Yes we're sad and sorry
We cannot go on in those days

I'm talking about my brothers
Yeah, I'm talking `bout sisters as well

Beware of the ones with invisible friends, they will steal into your mind

Live long live now

The house on the hill with the haunted eyes that call

There's no way we're born to shine before our time
All your life you're on your own, lonely road, lost in a time

Sewn together, joining heads

Millions laid out in their crowded tombs
Sickening ways to achieve the holocaust

Abacinate, eyes that bleed praying for the end of

Destruction fills my eyes
Harboring the image
Of a spiraling demise
Burning winds release their fury
Simulating judge and jury
Drifting flurries of pain

Deafening silence reigns
As twilight fills the sky
Eventual supremacy
As daylight waits to die
Darkness always calls my name
A pawn in this recurring game
Humanity going insane

Shades of death are all I see
Skeletons of society
Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be

Skeletons of society

Minutes seem like days
Corrosion fills the sky
Morbid dreams of anarchy
Brought judgment in disguise
Memories linger in my brain
Life with nothing more to gain
Perpetual madness remains

Shades of death are all I see

Fragments of what used to be

Welcome to my world, involve yourself within my dream
Experience a life just like your mind thought not to be
Take a look through time at past or present worlds to be
I rule this inferno, enthroned for eternity

Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned
Spirit in black until the end

Spirits damned to rot amidst the brimstone fireballs
Eyes of the dead watching from their living walls
Broken glass reflections show your flesh eaten away
Beyond the gates I'll take you where the blood forever rains

Coils of the serpent unwind
Buried beneath you will find
Deep in the halls of the damned

Looking on in wonder as I show you it was me
Burning from within, you know one spark is all it takes
Hear the piercing cries of all who found that hell awaits

Living nightmare, can't you see you really have no choice
Faded memories haunt you, listen closely to my voice
Feed me all your hatred, empty all your thoughts to me

Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece

You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'til there's no breath
Dismembered destiny

Flesh is all I need

Confront the God you seek

Oppression is the holy law
In God, I distrust
In time, His monuments will fall
Like ashes to dust

Is war and greed the master plan?
The Bible's where it all began
Its propaganda sells despair
And spreads the virus everywhere

Religion is hate

The pestilence is Jesus Christ
There never was a sacrifice
No man upon the crucifix
Beware the cult of purity
Infectious imbecility

Corruption breeds the pedophile
Don't pray for the priest
Confession finds the lonely child
God preys on the weak

Scream out loud, here's where you begin
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned

Entering tomb of a corpse yet conceived
Tighten the tourniquet around your neck

Sifting away debris of hated life
Cold touch of death begins to chill your spine
Seeking life beyond your perishment
Repeating words echoing through your mind

Chanting lines of blind witchery

Another casualty beyond the shadows you fall
Losing ground, the fate you feel it draws near

Vessels in my brain carry death until my birth
Come and die with me forever, share insanity, do you want to die?

This is God's war
God's war

Fucking holy war

Be optimistic, happy and calm
Show no fear or anxiety
Smile at the face of God
And your reward will be eternity

Holy warriors
Your patience will be justified
Everything is for Him
You must not comfort the animal
Before you kill it

Strike as champions
At the heart of the nonbelievers
Strike above the neck
And at all extremities

For it's a point of no return
For Almighty God, God will give victory
To His faithful servant
When you reach ground zero
You will have killed the enemy

Join in my quest to leave life overturned
Spanning the world wave of doom
Spewing out death with the evil I've churned
Awaken the dead from their tomb

Love turns to lust, the sensations I've felt
Exploring the pleasures of sin
Making the best of the cards I've been dealt
Adjusting the odds so I win

Unleash all my burning wrath
Potential killing machine
Take down all who block my path
Enjoying all obscene, born of fire

Prince of all darkness initiation
Ritually baptized in flames
Next to the throne, my abomination
Spreads terror throughout my domain

Master the art that controls the impure
Inherit the infamous keys
Thousands of centuries, I will endure
Tyrant of all prophecies

Some have called me Satan's son
A name I cannot deny
Wielding fury that's second to none
Far too vile to confine, born of fire

All things dead must rise again
When twilight's blanket falls
Splattered red, you'll find my den
Blood dripping from the wall

Dreams born of desire
Shaped and forged within the fire
Twisted, warped, deranged I see
The world's corrupt, insanity

Dreams possess nightmarish figures
Burning can't escape the embers
Lost are those who trust the liar
Satan's son, I'm born of fire

Evangelist you claim God speaks through you
Your restless mouth full of lies gains popularity
You care not for the old that suffer
When empty pockets cry from hunger

Penniless from their generosity
Sharing their money to quench your greed
Searchin' for the answer to their prayers
They cry their last wish of need
Save me

His spirit lives and breathes in me
The almighty transformed to your screen
The meanings lost in it's translation
No holy words, describe his deception

You say, "You'll help us find the Lord"
Tell me preacher how do you know?
A simple quest for a visible savior
To lead us through our final prayer
Save me

Send your donations, contribute to the cause
Luxuries, your righteous reward
Praise the Lord, praise God
Is what you wish to sell
There is no Heaven without a hell

In your mind's eye could you truly believe
That by giving you can save your soul
Could you be so naive
You heal the sick, you raise the dead
You blind the congregation with the things you say

Religious blackmail a deceit of trust
That death will come and all will be lost
Can you hear the serpents call?
Look deep in those deceiving eyes
Ignore the writing on the wall
You should read between the lies

When doubt subsides his honesty
An inquiry, is it blasphemy?
Impure the soul, that's made to suffer
No sermons left to hide or cover
An empty promise, lie unfulfilled
To steal a dream or get it killed
They claim your trip to Heaven's nearby
You may believe it but Satan wouldn't lie

Trapped by a cause that I once understood
Feeling a sickness building inside of me
Who will I really have to answer to?

March on through the rivers of red

Do only what is expected of me
With no emotions my feelings suppressed
Blind obedience carries me through it all
Conscience a word I learned to forget

Flesh burns, it fills the air

Nailed shut but my eyes still see
Severe anguish as my body evolves
The pain of life after death it resolves

Emptiness in twilight's rebirth
The faint sounds of shoveled earth
Madness growing as your mind dissolves
Merely secret in my dreams

Night grows cold, twilight's near
On the edge of madness, the wounds are sheared
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass

No spared breath
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode
Dead soul, stone cold, out into the night

Voices inside my head
Hold me under
Voices oppress
Like roaring thunder

An echo bouncing inside my brain
How much can I take of the pain?
The pain

A war raging deep inside my head
A split decision that will end with me dead

You see the agony in my eyes
Protruding aimless
I think it's time to die

A cannibal's desire feeds the fire
That burns in your head
Intense pain eats away at your brain
Thorazine pumping through your veins

Hear the sound of the bell
Counting off death tolls

Laughing as you eternally rot
Searching for human flesh

Attitude is my addiction
I live life with no regret
Unlike you, it's my conviction
That sets me apart from the rest

I live for competition
Your cynicism only makes me stronger
I am the culmination
Setting the standard that all will follow

I live it every day
Don't know another way

Within my eyes there's devastation
And fury you can't understand
In my fight, win by attrition
I bring it with all that I fucking am
All that I fucking am

You never dealt with such rejection
Licking your wounds that won't fucking heal
You've never seen so much aggression
I am the scream to your fucking silence

Unlike you, it's my affliction
That creates the template of all that I am

Like every other day

Something about you
Keeps you from letting go
Of lame obsessions
Built up inside you

Forget the guesswork
You're starting at the source
Gazing into my eyes
You'll see there's no remorse

'Cause this is my war
All day and every day
It's all about the conflict, yeah

Evangelist you claim God speaks through you
Your restless mouth full of lies gains popularity
You care not for the old that suffer
When empty pockets cry from hunger

Penniless from their generosity
Sharing their money to quench your greed
Searching for the answer to their prayers
They cry their last wish of need
Save me

His spirit lives and breathes in me
The almighty transformed to your screen
The meanings lost in its translation
No holy words, describe his deception

You say you'll help us find the lord
Tell me preacher how do you know
A simple quest for a visible savior
To lead us through our final prayer
Save me

Send your donations
Contribute to the cause
Luxuries
Your righteous reward?

Praise the lord, praise god
Is what you wish to sell
There is no heaven without a hell

In your mind's eye could you truly believe
That by giving you can save your soul
Could you be so naive
You heal the sick,youraise the dead
You blind the congregation
With the things you say

Religious blackmail a deceit of trust
That death will come and all will be lost

Can you hear the serpents call
Look deep in those deceiving eyes
Ignore the writing on the wall
You should read between the lies

When doubt subsides his honesty
An inquiry, is it blasphemy?
Impure the soul, that's made to suffer
No sermons left to hide or cover
An empty promise, lie unfulfilled
To steal a dream or get it killed
They claim your trip to heavens nearby
You may believe it but satan wouldn't lie

Rotting corpse
The smell of your putrid fucking soul

Petrified that I decide
The moment of your death
Belongs to me, the taste is sweet

Your God weeps, it bleeds
It begs for me
God is letting you recover

Welcome to my black serenade
The entrance to my hell, your pain
Scream your song, the black serenade
Live in fear, a mind insane

Voice inside my head
Your face still shows itself to me
Telling me you're dead
Staring at your lifeless body

I saw you fucking die
My mind's tearing itself apart
Screaming from the inside
Release this pain from my fucking heart

Destroy the empty shell
Smash away the haunting fear
I hate your endless stare
Watching as I fuck your corpse

Walk on through a tortured mind
You'll scream your song in time

Infecting everything that I do

Obliterate, depopulate
Divine, atrocious suffering
Cleansation of the weak, supremacy

Pissing on your faith
Incinerate God's whore
Perpetual is my reign

Crisis feed the lunacy, all fear the new machine
Consumed democracy returns a socialist regime
It's laid to rest without contest, all hail the new incompetence
Making you see what to believe, a drone in the world of anarchy

Treachery, misery, violence, insanity
Scavengers closing in covering the truth again
Castrate society, fictional reality

Insecurity afraid of things you cannot see
Words become the image of the enemy
You can't dissect what was correct
Vengeance based on how things are said
Can't see your side conflicts with mine
Frustrations lead to complete demise

Treachery, misery, violence, insanity
Scavengers closing in covering the truth again

Paralyze, criticize breaking through the wall of lies

Suicidal hierarchy racing in reverse
Everything that's done today will be tomorrow's curse
Screams in my head precede your death

Blind lead the blind, line after line in a world too shallow to defy

Leave the world in a dull disgrace
Fire all of your guns and once in

Damned to take risks on my own

Denied and laid to waste

A final thrill, a timely kill
Unbound, unguarded
Fantasized, realized
Enforced upon the dying

Free reign of the asylum
Archaic energy thrives
Dead cold, I control
Eternal screams that slowly die

Killing spree, first degree

Dementia born of sin
A symptom that begins
Vengeance so divine

Lost my grip of what's real
Unrestrained self-induced vertigo
Manic power chills my spine
I can't erase this instinct I embrace

Two faced moral abandon
Races my blood, boils my skin
Unhinging the doorway to this asylum
Releasing unshackled poison dreams

Beginning the end of temptation
A vengeance so divine

A vengeance so divine

Woe to you, oh earth and sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number its number is six hundred and sixty six

I lived alone my mind was blank
I needed time to think
To get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy
Just what I saw in my old dreams
Were they reflections of my warped mind
Staring back at me

'Cause in my dreams it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind
And brings me to despair

The night was black was no use holding back
'Cause I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real or just some kind of hell
666 the number of the beast hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
As they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires are burning bright
The ritual has begun Satan's work is done
666 the number of the beast, sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize can't avoid their eyes
666 the number of the beast, 666 the one for you and me

I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
You are the keeper of the mystery in your hands

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear, you are the ones that you despise
No one's certain what you future will behold
You're a legend, you own story will be told

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things but no one's seen you kill

Nomad, you're the rider, so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man's ever understood you're genius

Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that's all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone

Nomad, you're the rider, so mysterious
Nomad, you're the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you're the rider of the desert sands
No man ever understood you're genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one's spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some may say that you have killed a hundred men
Others say that you have died and live again

No man, ever understood you're genius

Middle winter cold winds blow
From the trees the snowflakes drifting
Swirling round like ghosts in the snow

Tells the time of a great empire
Turning round the old man ponders

Hold up your heads and be proud of what you are
Now it has come freedom at last

Live After Death
Rime Of The Ancient Mariner (Harris) 13:03
Hear the rime of the Ancient Mariner
See his eyes as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the Sea.

And the music plays on, and the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and the Mariner tells his tale.

Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies the albatross
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.

And the ship sails on, back to the North
Through the fog and the ice the albatross follows on

The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears, they justify him
And make themselves part of the crime.

Sailing on and on and North across the sea
Sailing on and on and North 'till all is calm.

The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible thirst a curse has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.

And the curse goes on and on at sea
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.

"Day after day, day after day, we stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water, water, everywhere and all the boards did shrink
Water, water, everywhere nor any drop to drink."

(Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1798-1834))

There, calls the mariner, there comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide.

See...onward she comes
Onward she nears, out of the sun
See...she has no crew
She has no life, wait but there's two.

Death and she Life in Death, they throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now.

Then...crew one by one
They drop down dead, two hundred men
She...She, Life in Death.
She lets him live, her chosen one.

Narrative
"One after one by the star dogged moon, too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang, and cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men (and I heard nor sigh nor groan),
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump. they dropped down one by one."

(Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1798-1834))

The curse it lives on in their eyes
The Mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on, so did he.

And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too.

Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the Sea
Then down in falls comes the rain.

Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes.

And revenge is still sought, penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.

Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and the Mariner's left alone.

And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The Pilot's boat, his son and the hermit.
Penance of life will fall onto Him.

And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrieves the mariner of his sins.

The Mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell his tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made.

And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and on.

The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool
Who are you kidding being that cool?
Trying to break away from running with the pack
But they ain't listening so you gotta go back
You're a weekend warrior when you're one of the crowd
But it's over
Just look at you now
Look at you now
Just look at you now
Just look at you now

You're not so brave the way you behave
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick
It's all bravado when you're out with your mates
It's like a different person goes through those gates
And the game begins, the adrenaline's high
Feel the tension
Maybe someone will die
Someone will die

You've gotta get out, gotta get away
But you're in with a clique, it's not easy to stray
You've gotta admit, you're just living a lie
It didn't take long to work out why
It's hard to say, "Why you got involved?"
Just wanting to be part
Just wanting to belong

A light in the black
Or just a fear of the dark

I am a man who walks alone
When I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park

When the light begins to fade
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, you, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?

Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?

And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

And the oily sea is the killing ground
His knuckles white, his eyes alight
He slams the hatch on the deadly night
A cunning fox in the chicken's lair

Running silent, running deep, sink into your final sleep

Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare

Live After Death
The Trooper (Harris) 3:59
You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back.

The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death.

The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race toward the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall.

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day.

We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below.

And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan
<EOS>
<BOS>
Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights

To the women and children, the souls of the dead
I've opened their book and no mercy is shed
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap
I don't give redemption, rewards for the meek

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a God to save you if you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this, if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on

Trapped in the web but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed
Show you the gates of tomorrow

Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow

Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame
There isn't a God to save you, if you don't save yourself
You can't blame a madman for this, if you go insane
Give me the strength so I carry on

Trapped in the web but I cut the threads
Show you the gates of tomorrow
Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead
Show you the gates of tomorrow

Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed

Sheriff Of Huddersfield
The Sheriff Of Huddersfield
(Harris - Dickinson - Smith - Murray - McBrain)

We´re on a mission from Rod..

Life in the city living in L.A.
Is a long way from Huddersfield town
The back of the Rainbow´s a long way from heaven
But that´s where he gethis pork pie
Limos and ladies they´re driving him crazy
Rugby and cricket´s unknown
Baseball and football they´re making him lazy
Your fan club says "Rodney come´ome"


The Sheriff of Huddersfield
Locked in his castle
Looked down on the Hollywood Hills
The Sheriff of Huddersfield
Locked in his castle
You´re our own Hot Rod on wheels


A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels
The Nautilus rusts in the yard
For Yorkshire he´s yearning but because he´s earning
He´ll always live in L.A.
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket
And never comes out to pay bills
He´s winning at poker and playing the Joker
And always cheats when he deals


Hello, let me introduce myself
My name´s Rodney
I´m immensely strong
When I were a lad
I could lift up
Five navies on the end of a shovel
The reason I never took up martial arts
Is because I was fearsome
And probably
Kill everybody
That I came into contact with
I was phenomenally strong


Pride and ego
My lads,
Pride and ego
Is what makes the world rotate,
And everybody knows that
The centre of the Universe is Huddersfield
That´s why I don´t live there anymore
I live in Los Angeles
It´s great!... I think


Rufus the red has a crane by his bed
To wrench himself up in the morn´
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed
You´ll wish you´d never been born
A bear with a sore head we don´t mean your forehead
He slumbers for most of the day
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast
Your problem Rodney is L.A.


The sin shines all night!

There's a madman in the corner of
Your eye
He likes to pry into your sunlight
He wants to burst into the street
With you and I
A world of shadows and of rain
He's seen what love is
He wants to pay you back with guilt

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned the key
He holds your chains of misery
He's got your chains of misery

There's a prophet in the gutter
In the street
He say "You're damned!" and you believe him
He's got a vision but it shines out
Through your eyes
A world of hatred and fear
He's felt what love means
He wants to pay you back with pain

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned the key
He holds your chains of misery

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned the key
He holds your chains of misery

It's only love that holds the key to
Our hearts
It's only love

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned the key
He holds your chains of misery

He lies to you, he won't let you be
He's got your chains of misery
He won't be still till he's turned the key

A lonely cry for help reaching out for help to anyone
A silent prayer to God to help you on your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life

You're searching in the dark
Clutching at straws to find a way
You take the tarot cards and throw them to the wind
Your questions your beliefs
Your inner thoughts, your whole existence
And if there is a God then answer if you will
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace

If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing or leave all the same
If you had the chance again
Would you change a thing at all
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud of what you've done
Now there times when you believe
That the right you thought was wrong

All of my life I have believed
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life I have believed
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Yea yea

All of my life now I have believed
Judgment of Heaven awaits for me
All of my life now I have believed
Judgment of Heaven awaits for me, yea

All of my life I have believed
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me
All of my life I have believed
Judgment of Heaven is waiting for me

Live After Death
Hallowed Be Thy Name (Harris) 7:17
I'm waiting in my cold cell when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
Cos at 5 o'clock they take me to the Gallows Pole
The sands of time for me are running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be there's some sort of error
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end not some crazy dream

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not so easy to stop from screaming
But words escape me when I try to speak
Tears they flow but why am I crying
After all I am not afraid of dying
Don't believe that there is never an end

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Someone calls from a cell "God be with you"
If there's a God then why has he let me die?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
And though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul cos it's willing to fly away

Mark my words please believe my soul lives on
Please don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to see the truth

When you know that your time is close at hand
maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down there is just a strange illusion.

Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive
And some of us are here just so that we'll die
How come the bullet hits the other guy

Be it the devil or be it him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

Are we the lucky ones saved for another day
Or they're the lucky ones who are taken away?
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the Lord above
Or the devil himself come to give you a shove?

Be it the devil or be it him
You can count on just one thing
When the time is up you'll know
Not just one power runs the show

A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away
A hurricane devastates the cities in its way
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind
The worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind

You can count on just one thing

If you're feeling down depressed and lonely
I know a place where we can go
22 Acacia Avenue
Meet a lady that I know

So if you're looking for a good time
And you're prepared to pay the price
Fifteen quid is all she asks for
Everybody's got their vice

If you're waiting for a long time
For the rest to do their piece
You can tell her that you know me
And you might even get it free

So any time you're down the East End
Don't you hesitate to go
You can take my honest word for it
She'll teach you more than you can know

Charlotte, can't you get out from all this madness?
Can't you see it only brings you sadness?
When you entertain your men
Don't know the risk of getting disease

Some day when you're reaching the age of forty
I bet you'll regret the days when you were laying
Nobody then will want to know
You won't have any beautiful wares to show any more

22, The Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight

Charlotte, isn't it time you stopped this mad life?
Don't you ever think about the bad times?
Why do you have to live this way?
Do you enjoy your lay or is it the pay?

Sometimes when your strolling down the Avenue
The way you walk it make men think of having you
When you're walking down the street
Everybody stops and turns to stare at you

22, The Avenue
That's the place where we all go
You will find it's warm inside
The red light's burning bright tonight

Beat her, mistreat her, do anything that you please
Bite her, excite her, make her get down on her knees
Abuse her, misuse her, she can take all that you've got
Caress her, molest her, she always does what you want

You're running away
Don't you know what you're doing?
Can't you see it'll lead you to ruin?
Charlotte, you've taken your life and you've thrown it away

You believe that because what you're earning
Your life's good
Don't you know that you're hurting?
All the people that love you don't cast them aside

All the men that are constantly drooling
It's no life for you stop all that screwing
You're packing your bags
And you're coming with me

Now the contracts out
They've put the word about

And the pattern of your ways

I've got you dead to rights
The triggers waiting for my finger

I feel adrenalin rush
It's just the final touch
You can kiss your arse goodbye

I stand alone in this desolate space
In death they are truly alive
Massacred innocence, evil took place
The angels were burning inside

Centuries later I wonder why
What secret they took to their grave?
Still burning heretics under our skies
Religion's still burning inside

At the gates and the walls of Montsigur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montsigur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

At the gates and the walls of Montsigur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montsigur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

As we kill them all so God will know His own
The innocents died for the pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross

Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on demand
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
To stand with the Cathars, to die and be free

The book of Old Testament crippled and black
Satan, his weapon is lust
Leaving this evil damnation of flesh
Back to the torture of lies

The perfect ones willingly died at the stake
And all of their followers slain
As for the knowledge of God they had claimed
Religion's still burning inside

At the gates and the walls of Montsigur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montsigur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

At the gates and the walls of Montsigur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montsigur

As we kill them all, so God will know His own
The innocents died for the pope on his throne
Catholic greed and its paranoid zeal
Curse of the grail and the blood of the cross

Templar believers with blood on their hands
Joined in the chorus to kill on command
Burned at the stake for their soul's liberty
Still running heretics under our skies

As we kill them all, so God know His own
Laugh at the darkness and in God we trust
The eye in the triangle smiling with sin
No passover feast for the cursed within

Facing the sun as they went to their grave
Burn like a dog or you live like a slave
Death is the price for your soul's liberty
To stand with the cathars to die and be free

At the gates and the walls of Montsigur
Blood on the stones of the citadel
At the gates and the walls of Montsigur
Blood on the stones of the citadel

At the gates and the walls of Montsigur

Behind my green door there's nothing to see
Is that a feature? What kind of creature
Would hang around waiting for a guy like me?

Stone cold sober, sitting in silence
Laid back, looking for sympathy
I like a girl who knows where she's bound
I don't like girls who've been hanging around

Hooks in you, hooks in me
Hooks in the ceiling for that well hung feeling
No big deal, no big sin
Strung up on love, I got the hooks screwed in

Here is the dream that makes monsters of men

In rooms of ugliness and cold
Memories locked away
All the doubts and fears I never faced

Now they come again
I am falling down to meet with them
Fear within us all
Mine awake and they stand up tall

Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you
Knife of the truth
Blade of hatred slicing through
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

I pray my sleep will break
Maybe this time I won't wake
Weakness I hide so well
This dagger in my mind will tell

It's my final stand
I make a fist out of each hand
To the shadows of the past
Take a breath and I scream attack

Look for the truth
Deepest cut of all from you

Run To The Hills (Harris) 3:52
White man came across the sea
Brought us pain and misery
Killed our tribes killed our creed
Took our game for his own need

We fought him hard we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?

Riding through dustclouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom a stab in the back
Women and children and cowards attack

Run to the hills run for your lives
Run to the hills run for your lives

Soldier blue on the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whisky and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old

Run to the hills run for your lives

As the sun breaks, above the ground,
An old man stands on the hill,
As the ground warms, to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still

His eyes are ablaze,
See the madman in his gaze.

Fly, on your way, like an eagle,
Fly as high as the sun,
On your way, like an eagle,
Fly, and touch the sun.

Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly.

His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream,
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave.

Do you really wanna face the truth?
Does it matter now, what have you got to loose?

Try to release the anger from within
Forgive yourself a few immortal sins
Do you really care what people think?
Are you strong enough to release the guilt?

Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack.

Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late.

Rolling, turning, diving, going in again
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
Run, fly to live, live to fly, Aces high.

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round, and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again.

Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns.

Thinking of an age old dream, places I have never seen,
Fantasies lived times before.
I split my brain, melt through the floor.

Over clouds my mind will fly, forever now I can't think why.
My body tries to leave my soul.
Or is it me, I just don't know.
Mem'ries rising from the past, the future's shaddow overcast.
Something's clutching at my head, through the darkness I'll be led.

Oh another time, another place.
Oh another smile on another face.
When you see me floating up beside you,
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.

Please take me away, take me away, so far away.
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.

You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back,
A footstep behind you, he lunges prepared for attack.
Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed,
Killer behind you, his blood lust defies all his needs.

My innocent victims are slaughtered with wrath and despise,
The mocking religion of hatred that burns in the night.
I have no one, I'm bound to destroy all this greed,
A voice inside me compelling to satisfy me.

I can see what a knife's meant to be,
And you'll never know how I came to forsee, see, see.

My faith in believing is stronger than lifelines and ties,
With the glimmer of metal my moment is ready to strike.

Death call arises, a scream breaks the still of the night,
Another tomorrow, remember to walk in the light!
I have found you, and now there is no place to run,
Excitement shakes me, oh God help me what have I done?!
Oooh yeah, I've done it!
YEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHH!

Scream for mercy, he laughs as he's watching you bleed,
Killer behind you, my blood lust defies all my needs.

Spit in your eye, I will defy

Kill for gain or shoot to maim.. but we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose & Never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside this Shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun, For the love of living death

The killer's breed or the demon's seed....The glamour, the fortune and the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain...Don't you pray for my soul anymore

2 minutes to midnight....The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight...To kill the unborn in the womb

The blind men shout let the creatures out, We'll show the unbelievers
Napalm screams of human flames, for a prime time Belsen feast
As the reasons for the carnage...Cut their meat & lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machines & feed it with our babies

The killer's breed or the demon's seed....The glamour, the fortune & the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain...Don't you pray for my soul anymore

2 minutes to midnight....The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight....To kill the unborn in the womb (SOLO)

The Body bags and little rags...Of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to Put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words & make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions, To make a better kind of gun

The killer's breed or the demon's seed....The glamour, the fortune, & the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain...Don't you pray for my soul anymore

2 minutes to midnight, To kill the unborn in the womb

The future's in the skies above
The heavens unfold
And a new star is born
Space and time makin' love

Chorus:
Oh what a time we had
Living on the ground
I've moved to station #5
See you next time around,
Next time around

As far you want, as close as you need
It's all in the mind, you know
This old world hasn't really seen it's day
It's here, time to go

Chorus

Remember when it was so clear
We were young, but the memory still remains
To pick fruit from a tree
Fish from the seas
Now nothing's left here, but the stains
Well I can't cry no more
Can only be glad
There's other places we can be
If the time suits you right
I'm leaving tonight
Come fly away
With me!
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Oh, yeah

Start, with the sun
And move on out
The future's in the skies above
The heavens unfold
A new star is born
Space and time makin' love

Live After Death
The Number Of The Beast (Harris) 4:48
I left alone my mind was blank
I needed time to get the memories from my mind

What did I see can I believe that what I saw
that night was real and not just fantasy

Just what I saw in my old dreams were they
reflections of my warped mind staring back at me

Cos in my dreams it's always there the evil face that twists my mind
and brings me to despair

The night was black was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see was someone watching me
In the mist dark figures move and twist
was all this for real or some kind of hell
666 the Number of the Beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
as they start to cry hands held to the sky
In the night the fires burning bright
the ritual has begun Satan's work is done
666 the Number of the Beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight

This can't go on I must inform the law
Can this still be real or some crazy dream
but I feel drawn towards the evil chanting hordes
they seem to mesmerise me...can't avoid their eyes
666 the Number of the Beast
666 the one for you and me

I'm coming back I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course

Live After Death
Revelations (Dickinson) 5:59
"O God of Earth and Altar,
Bow down and hear our cry,
Our earthly rulers falter,
Our people drift and die,
The walls of gold entomb us,
The swords of scorn divide,
Take not thy thunder from us,
But take away our pride."
(G. K. Chesterton: English Hymnal)

Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
An easy way for the blind to go,
A cleaver path for the fools who know
The Secret of the Hanged Man -- the smile on his lips.

The light of the Blind -- you'll see,
The venom that tears my spin,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening -- you'll see

She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips,
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
So we lay in a black embrace,
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched, and I waited for the Dawn.

The light of the Blind -- you'll see,
The venom that tears my spin,
The Eyes of the Nile are opening -- you'll see

Bind all of us together,
Ablaze with Hope and Free,
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see,
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain,
For the one who will be King
Is the Watcher in the Ring
It is You.

I've been looking so long for you now, you won't get away from my grasp.
You've been living so long in hiding. Hiding behind that false mask.

You know and I know that you ain't got that long to last,
Your looks and feelings are just the remains of your past

Standing in the wings there, you wait for the curtain to fall.
Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all.

I know that you're gonna scratch me and maim me and maul.
You know I'm helpless from your mesmerising cat call.

Keep your distance, walk away don't take his bait.
Don't you stray don't fade away.

Watch your step, he's out to get you
Come what may,
Don't you stray, don't fade away.

I'm running and hiding, in my dreams you're always there.
You're the Phantom of the Opera, you're the devil you're just out to scare.

You damaged my mind and my soul just floats through the air.
You haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair.

Iron Maiden - The Sign Of The Cross
=====================================

Steve Harris


Eleven saintly shrouded men
Silhouettes stand against the sky
One in front with a cross held high
Come to wash my sins away

Standing alone in the wind and rain
Feeling the fear that is growing
Sensing the change in the tide again
Brought by the storm that is brewing
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear
Some of the doubt in the things you believe
Now that your faith will be put to the test
Nothing to do but await what is coming

Why the is God still protecting me
Even when I don't deserve it
Though I am meant to face this alone
Asking the question time and again
Praying to God won't keep me alive
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise...

They'll be saying their prayers when the moment comes
There'll be penance to pay when it's judgment day
And the guilty'll bleed when that moment comes
They'll be coming to claim, take your soul away

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose... a fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

They'll be comming to bring the eternal flame
They'll be bringing us all immortality
Holding communion so the world be blessed
My creator, my God'll lay my soul to rest

The sign of the cross
The name of the rose... a fire in the sky
The sign of the cross

Lost the love of heaven above
Chose the lust of the earth below
Eleven saintly shrouded men
Came to wash my sins away

Ah Ha! Ha! Ha! Haaaa! Maybe I can get out of here now! Oh, this is Nicko's "not alot of people know that,
number ten". When I finish this I can go home! Ahahaha! Ah oh, why do I want to go home? Oh I don't
know, I've been in here so long, oh I'm stuck to the chair and all that kind of good stuff... And I've had so
much fun mumbling on to you guys and telling you jokes and all that stuff and this is the last one! Well at
least I can go and have a bath. Hmmmmm, it's about that time of the year anyway. Hahahaha!
Well! You despicable heathenistic civilictic god knows what else... mumbling jumbling oooh big single
buying public have got in your greasy sweaty horrible... oooh! How is your stereo still spinning around and
that little needle bouncing up and down in all that grime? You have got The Clairvoyant, Prisoner, Heaven
Can Wait, released the 7th of November 1988 chart position number six! Yes! And on the other side you've
got Infinite Dreams, Killers, Still Life - Harris and Murray wrote that song, debuted number twelve, got to
number six again! My goodness! And that was released the 6th of November 1989! Oh, here, have you just
noticed something... something a bit weird about that? Yeah, I don't know whether that Eddie's got anything
to do with that Seventh Son business, but those were both released... those singles, within one year of each
other to the day almost. Released 7th of November '88, Infinite Dreams released 6th of November '89. A bit
strange and all that...
Well look at that! Let's go on, I don't really... I started getting tingles up the back, I don't like that. Dave?
Oh, get out of here. Anyway, no. Hahaha! Jeez, four top ten singles in a year to two years actually. By the
time you lot are listening to this, which is February, I mean as we know Can I Play With Madness was
released the 2nd of March '88 and we're at the sort of end of February. That's close to two years isn't it?
That's bloody good I think, considering we had a year off. I mean, god bless you lot out there, I mean, you
know, to not actually have done anything in a year and we pulled out like a single, you know, Infinite
Dreams... And by the way that was off the new Maiden England video which we shall talk about in a
minute... you know, after a year you pushed it up to number six for us, and god bless you all, because it's
nice to know that you ain't forgotten us. You know.
Anyway! The Clairvoyant, Prisoner... all live renditions, my goodness, of the most severe kind! I should
know, I was there wasn't I! Sooty was there too, did you notice? Anyway, enough of him, stupid soddy bear,
he doesn't know even how to talk or anything else, stupid git! Anyway! The Clairvoyant, Prisoner, and
Heaven Can Wait were recorded in front of you lot as I said I believe earlier on. If I didn't, as I said again on
previous "not alot of people knows that" f'king too f'king bad! A hundred and seven thousand of ya! Wooah!
At Donnington on August the 20th 1988, you can lucky people, you've not only got the live renditions, you
were there, probably! And there was Kiss, David Lee Roth, all kinds of people. My goodness, what a great
day. Anyway, those as I say were recorded and were a special little single release to you from us lot
celebrating the 20th of August for us, because that was... I told you this, we got on stage 20 minutes early
for that gig. We got a guy called Dicky Bell, my goodness the Das Furher Bell we called him because he's
like Hitler - right asshole! Anyway hah! He comes in the dressing room and he goes, "right you horrible lot,
you musician slime, you scumbags, you sleazeballs, get on that stage now, it's time to do your show, you
lazy bastards!" All that sort of stuff, right? "Oh good afternoon Dick, well good evening Dick..." you know,
(unintelligible)... of we go. We were convinced that he'd actually come in the dressing room at Donnington
that evening and told us to get on stage. But he actually didn't. And we got on stage and he goes, "Right!
What the f'king hell are you lot doing up here? Piss of my stage, get up here when I tell ya!" We said,
"Look! Rumour has it we're supposed to be doing a gig. Anyway you stupid prat, you told us to get up here."
"No I f'king didn't!" he said. We said, "You f'king did!" He said "I f'king didn't!" Boof! Stuck us in the
eyeballs! Take that for openers! "Look here Dick, why the hell we up here for if somebody didn't come
around..." He said, "You fucking show him off to me, I'll have a word with him... tell my band to come up
here when I ain't ready!" So, we get on stage, as I said, ten minutes early and we had ten minutes before we
had to get, you know, actual showtime. So, cause we get up there and get warmed up the various bits,
twiddly old exercises, Steve checks is bass, all the boys... and Bruce goes round the back and does the
various gobbing in the old facial mask thing and all that, and ah ha! Oh we all do the bits, you know.
So we actually had an extra ten minutes on stage looking at you lot standing out there waiting for us lot to
come up and do it, and so.... (farting noises).... "You nervous?" "No." "What was that?" "Somebody step on
a duck?" "I dunno!" The air turned blue! We had all these film crews around there trying to film us, and they
soon left, hahaha! They got out of there quick, they knew how to get out while the going was good, you
know what I mean.
So what can I say man, what a fantastic experience! Something that will live with me for the rest of my life,
no doubt about that. And, I mean we played like a cat on a tin roof, and we all thought it was a blazing gig.
But we later found out and we thought the tape was running slow when we recorded it but nevertheless...
enough said about that! Hahaha!
Moving on to Infinite Dreams, Killers, and Still Life! Ohh god it's tormenting me! I'm sitting here, I'm
strapping myself into this chair with the lead and cable from these headphones trying to restrain myself! My
goodness! It was only a year ago that I played these songs for you with the band and all! I miss it so much!
Oh gosh, it debuted at twelve and it got to number six, didn't it, not so many weeks ago! Released the 6th of
November 1989, my gosh, one year to the day of The Clairvoyant's release. A bit uncanny, as I say.
Nevertheless! These three songs were taken from the band's gig at the NEC in Birmingham, which was
recorded around I think Novermber the 28th, 1988... 27th it was... and the 28th, we did two gigs! Hah ha ho!
So, what can I say? We listened... now actually Steve... let me say this, Steve directed and edited this here
Maiden England video, and he set up all the camera angles and told the guys what he wanted, and it took six
months to edit this piece of work, 90 minutes worth of music. And I've got to say this, he done the most
stunning job I think I've ever seen, and I'm saying that... I'm saying that because... I didn't have to crawl to
him because I did that last week, I've got a brown tongue and warm kneepads! Hahahah! No, serious piece
of work! No, as you will agree with me, it is, isn't it? I mean, I haven't seen a music video that's so clear, so
good, and well put together. It's really... I'm proud to have been on that, because it's f'king great. And we
decided actually, when we heard the soundtrack we were really so tempted to realease it as a live album
again, cause it was really good and Martin recorded the band so well in that room, it was really nice. But we
settled for taking a single off of it, because we thought, you know, it wasn't the right time to do another, you
know, a second live album. But you know, it means it's well... I guess for the fans without access to the
video will have a souvenier of the '88 tour won't you? Because you can stick this lot on your f'king stereo, as
long as it ain't screwed up with all the sticky horrible debauched singles you stuck on prior to this, as long as
your stilus still bounces over the grooves and does all that good stuff it'll be allright won't it?
Hey, by the time you've got this lot in your hands, by the way, we shall have been in the studio working on a
brand new album! Yes! Oooh, it's gonna be out later this year. And we may, or we may not, you never
know, have another four top ten singles, thanks to you lot. And I'm going to work it out and say to them...
say to you lot, it's about that time to wind this up. I mean, I've had such a great time speaking to you.... you...
you lot! F'king hell! Oh dear, we'll have to do this again sometime, I'd like to. That's it! No, and... basically
thanking you lot.... you greasy slugs! You.... you grubby lucky little people! No I'm kidding, hahaha!
Thanks for ten great fantastic Maidenesque years of boogalooing through the, you know, the lunchaloms of
this business... getting up there and giving it all the good old heavy metal welly, which we need more of!
Lots of big heavy metal welly's everywhere, squashing all that grief stuff, all that rap shit and all that good
crap that's out there that that Bleedin Bojack Company play all the time and that fucking Mighty Tight Veg
cause they haven't got a clue anymore have they? Anyway! Toodle-do to you lot! Thanks alot to the gov'nor,
'Arry Harris, and Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson, and the gov'nor Rod Smallwood, Andy
Taylor, and all the boys... Tony Wiggins, Dick Bell, and everybody else who's involved, my drum tech
especially, Gadsy! And EMI, for whom without them I wouldn't be here talking to you lot, mumbling and
jumbling, and you wouldn't have had f'king half a dozen, seven or eight, f'king albums of the band, all that
good stuff, to be mumbling jumbling and listening to. So, as I said... oh yeah, is it, no... I was going to tell
you a joke, but I've decided I've run out of them, and they ain't very funny anyway, so bollocks! That's all I
can say to that! And as I say, as 'Arry Harris says, as he says it very well, there's only one 'um, and that's
fuck'um! So, god bless ya, and I'll see ya... if I don't see you in the spring, as I said on one of the other "not
alot of people know that", I'll see you in a mattress!

Green is the cat's eye that glows -- in this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris -- risen again.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God, why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid waste,
And in my last hour, I'm a Slave to the Power of Death.

When I was living this lie -- Fear was my Game
People would worship and fall -- drop to their knees.
So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me,
For he is a man and a God -- and He will die too.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God, why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid waste,
And in my last hour, I'm a Slave to the Power of Death.

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,
Silent the terror that reigned -- marbled in stone.
Shell of a man God preserved -- a thousand ages,
But open the gates of my Hell -- I will strike from the grave.

Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a God, why can't I live on?

Smiles as the flame sears his flesh
Melting his face screaming in pain

I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry.
I'll never know the reason why I had to go.
Oh, oh, I'm crying,
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?

I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me.
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's
Like to be hanging on the other side.
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died.

I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone,
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone.
Oh, oh, I'm crying,

I remember it as plain as day
		although it happened in the dark of the night.
I was strolling through the streets of Paris
		and it was cold it was starting to rain.
And then I heard a piercing scream
		and I rushed to the scene of the crime
but all I found was the butchered remains
		of two girls lay side by side.

Murders in the Rue Morgue
		someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
		run before the killers go free

There's some people coming down the street
		at last there's someone heard my call
I can't understand why they're pointing at me
		I never done nothing at all.
But I must have got some blood on my hands
		because everyone's shouting at me
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain
		and like a fool I started running away.

Murders in the Rue Morgue
		someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
		am I ever gonna be free.

And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.
All France is looking for me.
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure
		down the south to Italy.

Murders in the Rue Morgue
		someone call the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
		I'm never going home.

Well I made it to the border at last
		But I can't erase the scene from my mind
Anytime somebody stares at me, well
		I just start running blind
Well I'm moving through the shadows at night
		Away from the staring eyes
Any day they'll be looking for me
		'Cause I know I show the signs of...

Murders in the Rue Morgue
		running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
		running from the arms of the law

Murders in the Rue Morgue
		running from the Gendarmes
Murders in the Rue Morgue
		am I ever gonna be free

It took so long and I'm getting so tired
		I'm running out of places to hide
Should I return to the scene of the crime
		Where the two young victims died
If I could go to somebody for help
		It'd get me out of trouble for sure
But I know that it's on my mind
		That my doctor said I've done it before.

Murders in the Rue Morgue
		they're never gonna find me
Murders in the Rue Morgue

Prodigal Son - Steve Harris
===========================
Listen to me Lamia, listen to what I've got to say.
I've got these feelings, and they won't go away.
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees.
Oh help me Lamia or I'm sure I'll die, oh please.

I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong.
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for too long.
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me,
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be.

I'm on my knees, oh help me please.
I'm on my knees, help me please.

Oh Lamia please try to help me.
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.
Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.
The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh

Oh Lamia please try to help me.
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.
Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.
The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh

Judment Of Heaven

Iron Maiden - Judment Of Heaven
=================================

Steve Harris

A lonely cry for help reaching out for help
to anyone
A silent prayer to God to help you your way
I've been depressed so long
It's hard to remember when I was happy
I've felt like suicide a dozen times or more
But that's the easy way, that's the selfish way
The hardest part is to get on with your life

You're searching in the dark
Clutching at straws to find a way
You take the Tarot cards
And throw them to the wind
Your question your beliefs, your inner thoughts,
your whole existence
And if there is a God then answer if you will
And tell me of my fate, tell me of my place
Tell me if I'll ever rest in peace

If you could live your life again
Would you change a thing
Or leave it all the same
If you had the chance again
Would you change a thing at all
When you look back at your past
Can you say that you are proud
Of what you've done
Are there times when you believe
that the right you thought was wrong

All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me

All of my life now I have believed
Judgement of Heaven awaits for me

All of my life I have believed
Judgement of Heaven is waiting for me
Is waiting for me ...

Until I find him I'm never gonna stop searching,

It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry

Iron Maiden - Alexander the Great [356 - 323 BC]
==============================================

(Harris)

"My son, ask for thyself another kingdom,
For that which I leave is to small for thee."

Near to the East, in a part of ancient Greece,
In an ancient land called Macedonia,
Was born a son to Philip of Macedon,
The legend his name was Alexander.

At the age of nineteen, he became the Macedon king,
And swore to free all of Asia Minor,
By the Aegian Sea in 334 BC,
He utterly beat the armies of Persia.

Chorus:
Alexander the Great,
His name struck fear into hearts of men,
Alexander the Great,
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men.

King Darius the third, Defeated fled Persia,
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes,
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon king as well,
And he founded the city called Alexandria.

By the Tigris river, he met King Darius again,
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela,
Entering Babylon and Susa, treasures he found,
Took Persepolis, the capital of Persia.

Chorus:
Alexander the Great,
His name struck fear into hearts of men,
Alexander the Great,
Became a god amongst mortal men.

A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke,
And Alexander cut the "Gordion knot",
And legend said that who untied the knot,
He would become the master of Asia.

Helonism he spread far and wide,
The Macedonian learned mind,
Their culture was a western way of life,
He paved the way for Christianity.

Marching on, Marching on.

The battle weary marching side by side,
Alexander's army line by line,
They wouldn't follow him to India,
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory.

Chorus:
Alexander the Great,
His name struck fear into hearts of men,
Alexander the Great,
He died of fever in Babylon.

Hand of fate is moving and finger points to you
He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do
Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say
The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun, a new born in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

Your time will come
Your time will come

The Ferryman wants his money, you ain't going to give it back
He can push his own boat as you set up off the track
Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same
Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every night
Dancing in the sun, a new born in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the Wickerman is rising up again

Here is the soul of a man
Here in this place for the taking
Clothed in white, standing in the light
Here is the soul of a man

Time to speak with the shaman again
Conjure the jester again
Black dog in the ruins is howling my name
So here is the soul of a man

When the world was virgin
Before the coming of men
Just a solar witness
The beginning of the end
From a world of magma
To a cold rock face
The ascent of madness
And a human race

We are strange believers, all of us
There are stranger truths, immortal lust
We rise from slumber, he calls our name
Recalls our number, abide with pain

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

To God's illusion, which I recall
Was our delusion
Before the fall
The angels come and the angels go
But the lord of light shining below

Eternal darkness beyond the stars
We think our wisdom will get that far
At the master's table, the table's bare
No land of plenty, devastation, despair

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time
If eternity should fail

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time

Reef in a sail at the edge of the world
If eternity should fail
Waiting in line for the ending of time

Good day, my name is Necropolis

Winter softly falling to the ground
Calmly waiting, don't you hear a sound?

When the world has fallen to the depths below
Where the future's open and the fear has grown

And the path to follow to the great unknown
Where the dark has fallen and the seed is sown

In the selfish heart of some
The nightmare's coming
With the spilling blood of others
Now wringing through

Now the cup is spilling over
Wake to news of death
And the prophecy of sages
Destiny is met

To the depths of human mind
The cry is burning
With the mentor's anger
Of the lesson ringing true

And for those who live by and are dying by the sword
They will take their ideals with them
Justify their end

Where the fools are lying and the meek are crying
Where the wolves are preying
On the weak alone

Where the sons are dying
hear their mothers crying
And the distant sound of fire
begins again

Never ending the desires of men
It'll never be the same or calm again
In a time of changing hearts
And great unknown
It'll be the damnation and end of us all

Step inside my inquisitive mind
Are you scared at what you just might find?

See myself in the hall of mirrors
A different shape every step I take
A different mind every step of the line
But in the end they are all mine

Laughing sorrow inside your head
Can't get out, just a feeling of dread
I know this burden is a heavy load
A dark mistake, never ending road

The black jack king and the red queen clash
The artful dodger, he counts his stash
The joker's wild like an impish child
While Madame Fortune see what's inside

The good luck charm is overkill
The tired old soldier says fire at will
Planes overhead go search and destroy
The ones below human decoy

I need somebody to save me

Meanwhile we play the waiting game
The clock is struck, the horse is lame
And when we think that this is done
Chance your luck a four leafed one

You hedge your bets, the battle lost
To wait in vain and count the cost
The thin edged line
Between good and bad
And cast the luck, be happy and sad

I need somebody to save me

People don't want the truth
Look in their eyes and you send them away

Burden's a heavy load there is no doubt

Wandering aimlessly in a cold dark mist I follow
Walking in a dark world that’s been
Kissed with sadness
Without sunlight things are born
To the dead of nightmares
Soulless demons laughing in a sea of madness

Listen closely to the raven’s call
Praying hard for our world not to end
Try as might to make sense of it all
Will it be for the penance of men
Follow north for the call of the wild
Look all out for a small wayward child
Lay in fear as the dark raven crows
Look for guidance from the one who knows
He lived on this earth for a time and a half
Playing a tune to the old man’s laugh
The fear that’s inside the men of the oath
In the script of the book that he wrote

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

As the raven again passes by
I can hear all the wake fathers cry
That the first born of all men will die
That their lives will be taken from them
Face the danger a battle of wills
Strength and courage a cure for all ills
We believe in that thou shall not kill
But others are ready to spill
The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I’ll take my last breath

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

The hearts of all men since beginning of time
Living with temptation
Wanting and crime
A walk in the shadow of the valley of death
Knowing I’ll take my last breath

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter
Cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

Into the valley of death fear no evil
We will go forward no matter the cost
Into the valley of death follow me now
Bring me your souls and I’ll make it our last

Ask them the questions
Tell them no lies
A cry for freedom
Praying that they wouldn’t die
Mind over matter, cry over sins
Their lives are over now
Ended before they begin

All alone in a crowded room
He tries to force a smile
The smile it beamed or so it seemed

But never reached the eyes, disguise
Masquerading as the funny man do they despise

The false smile maketh of the man
Glass empty or half full
Try to make some sense or sorrows drown

All looks well on the outside
Underneath the solemn truth
There's soething that inside has died

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown

Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Who motivates the motivator?
Façade it has to go
He knows it sooner or later
Smile for the camera, all OK
But tomorrow is another day he must get through

He had a longer way to run
Or so the story goes
Life full of fun where did it go

We saw the sadness in his eyes
It came as no surprise
And now of course we'll never know

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown

Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling drowned
Tears of a clown

Tomorrow comes, tomorrow goes
But the cloud remains the same
Wonder why he's feeling down
Tears of a clown

Maybe it's all just for the best
Lay his weary head to rest
Was forever feeling down
Tears of a clown

Tear of a clown...

Like a man without a home
Watching people come and go
Carry on their daily lives
Without a thought for the ones alone

Cast the dream aside like throwing
A pebble into the ocean tide
And I'm feeling so alone again

Free the angry from their pain
Free the captives from their chains
Cast aside the doubt that
Nothing good can come their way again

Living in a world of lies
No matter how or hard we try
Living life without a dream today

Looking through a mist of truth
That we believe an elusive cloud
The things we find are hard to say now
That we live through day to day
Find it hard to force the reasons
Why we find it hard to die

Now we need to know the truth now
Open our eyes that we can see
So we live and breathe again
Better days for you and me
Can we even hope to deliver this
We are so far away

As one turns against the other
With a brother against brother
Situation like no other it's a picture of despair

As we look to see the man of sorrows
Passing knowledge to those
Who don't know
As we watch all our friends passing over
As they pass through the edges of time

And we see what's ahead that awaits us
That no longer do we feel afraid
So we look to see the man of sorrows
And the light is the darkness no more

To ride the storm, to an empire of the clouds
To ride the storm, they climbed aboard their silver ghost
To ride the storm, to a kingdom that will come
To ride the storm, and damn the rest, oblivion

Royalty and dignitaries, brandy and cigars
Gray Lady, giant of the skies, you hold them in your arms
"The millionth chance," they laughed, "to take down His Majesty’s craft."
“To India,” they say, “magic carpet float away,” an October fateful day

Mist is in the trees, stone sweats with the dew
The morning sunrise, red before the blue
Hanging at the mast, waiting for command
His majesty’s airship, the r101

She’s the biggest vessel built by man, a giant of the skies
For all you unbelievers, the Titanic fits inside
Drum roll tight, her canvas skin, silvered in the sun
Never tested with the fury, with a beating yet to come

The fury yet to come….

In the gathering gloom, the storm rising in the West
The Coxswain stared into the plunging weather glass
We must go now, we must take our chance with fate
We must go now, for a politician, he can’t be late

The airship crew awake for thirty hours at full stretch,
But the ship is in their backbone, every sinew, every inch
She never flew at full speed, a trial never done
Her fragile outer cover, her Achilles would become
An Achilles yet to come...

Sailors of the sky, a hardened breed
Loyal to the king, and an airship creed
The engines drum, the telegraph sounds
Release the cords that bind us to the ground

Said the Coxswain, “Sir, she’s heavy, she’ll never make this flight.”
Said the Captain, “Damn the cargo! We’ll be on our way tonight.”
Groundlings cheered in wonder, as she backed off from the mast
Baptizing them her water, from the ballast fore and aft
Now she slips into our past…

[Instrumental section starts with all instruments playing SOS Morse code]

[Solos: Murray, Smith]

Fighting the wind as it rolls you,
Feeling the diesels that push you along
Watching the Channel below you,
Lower and lower, into the night

Lights are passing below you
Northern France, asleep in their beds
Storm is raging around you,
A million to one, that’s what he said

Reaper standing beside her
With his scythe cuts to the bone
Panic to make a decision
Experienced men, asleep in their graves

Her cover is ripped and she’s drowning
Rain is flooding into the hull
Bleeding to death and she’s falling
Lifting gas is draining away

“We’re down lads!” came the cry, bow plunging from the sky
Three thousand horses silent as the ship began to die
The flares to guide her path ignited at the last
The empire of the clouds, just ashes in our past
Just ashes at the last…

Here lie their dreams as I stand in the sun
On the ground where they built, and the engines did run
To the moon and the stars, now what have we done?
Oh, the dreamers may die, but the dreams live on

Dreams live on
Dreams live on

Now a shadow on a hill, the angel of the east
The empire of the clouds may rest in peace
And in a country churchyard, laid head to the mast
Eight and forty souls, who came to die in France…

You walk through the subway
His eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you
He lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy
He laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you
His blood lust defies all his needs

My innocent victims
Are slaughtered with wrath and despise
The mocking religion
Of hatred that burns in the night
I have no one
I'm bound to destroy all this greed
A voice inside me
Compelling to satisfy me

I can see
What a knife's meant to be
You'll never know
How I came to forsee, see, see

My faith in believing
Is stronger than lifelines and ties
The glimmer of metal
My moment is ready to strike
The death call arises
A scream breaks the still of the night
Another tomorrow
Remember to walk in the light

I have found you
And now there is no place to run
Excitement shakes me
Oh God help me what have I done?
I've done it again

You walk through the subway
My eyes burn a hole in your back
A footstep behind you
He lunges prepared for attack
Scream for mercy
He laughs as he's watching you bleed
Killer behind you
My blood lust defies all my needs

I'm stranded in space, I'm lost without trace
I haven't this chance of getting away
Too close to the sun and surely will burn
Like Icarus before me or so legend goes
I'm taking my life, reliving the past
There's nothing but wait til' my time comes
I've had a good life, I'd do it again
Maybe I'll come back some time, my friends

For I have lived my life to the full
I have no regrets anekatips
But I wish I could talk to my family to tell them
One last goodbye

The final frontier
The final frontier

If I could survive to live one more time
I wouldn't be changing a thing at all
Do more in my life than some do in ten
I'd go back and do it all over again

I have no regrets
But I wish I could talk to my family and tell them
that one last goodbye

The final frontier guitar solo

There isn't much time, must say my last rites
Nobody is here to read them to me
Must say my goodbyes, if only a line
A message to tell them in case they might find

But I have filled my life to the full
I have no regrets

Kill for gain or shoot to maim
But we don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season.
Blackened pride still burns inside
This shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death.

The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune and the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore.

2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom.
2 minutes to midnight

To kill the unborn in the womb.
The blind men shout let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers

The Napalm screams of human flames
Of a prime time Belsen feast... YEAH!

As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune and the pain

Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore.
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom.

2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb.
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you

As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions, to make a better kind of gun.
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour, the fortune and the pain
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore.

The hands that threaten doom.

To kill the unborn in the womb.

When I stand and look about the port
And contemplate my life, will I ever see my countrymen again?

As the captain calls us on the deck, I take my things and walk
To the harbor side I glance back one last time
Fleeing our nation, our problems we leave behind
Ships by the tenfold sail out on the tide

We are pleased to be out and embracing the open sea
Free from our troubles and more free from thee
Inheritors unfulfilled reason behind us
We flee from what is not, what is will be

We flee the earth and face our harsh reality
Will death be low mist that hangs on the sea?
We run from the evil tongues, rash judgments, selfish men
Never to be seen on these shores again

As we sail into ocean size and lose sight of land
A face of contentment around in the air
We're off now to seek all our fortunes
To the land of our dreams

Riding the waves and the storm is upon us
The winds lash the sails but the ropes keep them tight
Off in the distance a dark cloud approaching
None could imagine what there was to come

No, there's no one going back, no, there's not a second chance
As we strap onto the side, we pray to God that we won't die

As we ride the rough seas, as we soak from the ocean waves
I just hope for all our lives and pray that I survive
Four ships are lost in the stormy conditions
The spirits of the sunken crews, their phantoms follow us

Spirits, sails, they drive us on through the all consuming waves
Cold mortality, no weapon against these ever raging seas

Four leagues and ten and we hit storms again
We just can't get away from the eye of the storm
The birds out soar the raging storm but we cannot escape it
Abandoned earth that we now crave is many leagues from safe

Holding on for our dear lives and we're praying once again
Rotten luck or just jonahed? The talisman is in my hand

Limbs fatigued, trembling with cold, blinded from the sea spray salt
Clasping anything we can hold, heaven's rain upon us falls
Twenty days without a meal and ten without fresh water still
Those that didn't die in storms, the scurvy rest did slaughter

Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman

We approach the other side of the ocean with the tide
In our favor just for once, welcome greeting, our new land
The elation in our hearts, the excitement in our veins
As we sail towards the coastline of our golden promised land

Weary limbs fatigued away, I have no life left in me
No more strength and nothing left to give, must find the will to live
Never thought that we could make it, truly sight of shores divine
The sickness I am dying from, never wanted it to end this way

Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman
Westward the tide, westward we sail on
Westward the tide, sail by the talisman

When I stand before you shining
In the early morning Sun
When I feel the engines roar
And I think of what we've done

Oh the bittersweet reflection
As we kiss the earth goodbye
As the waves and echoes of the
Towns become the ghosts of time

Over borders that divide the
Earthbound tribes
No creed and no religion
Just a hundred winged souls

We will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birth

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see the
Runway lights
In the misty dawn
The night is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay

Curving on the edge of daylight
'til it slips into the void
Waited in the long night dreaming
'til the Sun is born again

Stretch the fingers of my hand
Cover countries with my span
Just a lonely satellite
Speck of dust in cosmic sand

Over borders that divide the
Earthbound tribes
Flown the dark Atlantic
Over mariners stormy graves

We will ride this thunderbird
Silver shadows on the earth
A thousand leagues away
Our land of birth

To Albion's land
Coming home when I see the
Runway lights
In the misty dawn
The night is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight
Where I've been tonight
You know I will not stay

To Albion's land
Coming home
When I see the runway lights
In the misty dawn the night
Is fading fast
Coming home far away
As the vapour trails alight

You know I will not stay

In the misty dawn the night

Let me tell you a story to chill the bones
Out of things that I saw.
One night wandering in the everglades
I'd one drink but no more.
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight
Gazing up at the stars.
Not aware of a presence so near to me
Watching my every move.
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees
As something rushed me from the trees.
Took me to an unholy place
And that is where I fell from grace.
Then they summoned me over to join in with them
To the dance of the dead.
Into the circle of fire I followed them
Into the middle I was led.
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear
But still I wanted to go.
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me
As I walked onto the coals.
And I felt I was in a trance
And my spirit was lifted from me.
And if only someone had the chance
To witness what happened to me.
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them
All had death in their eyes.
Lifeless figures, they were undead all of them

They had ascended from hell.
As I danced with the dead
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me.
Below my undead body just danced the circle of dead.
Until the time came to reunite us both
My spirit came back down to me.
I didn't know if I was alive or dead
As the others all joined in with me.
By luck then a skirmish started
And took the attention away from me.
When they took their gaze from me
Was the moment that I fled.
I ran like hell faster than the wind
But behind I did not glance.
One thing that I did not dare
Was to look just straight ahead.
When you know that your time has come around
You know you'll be prepared for it.
Say your last goodbyes to everyone
Drink and say a prayer for it.
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead.
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead.
To this day I guess I'll never know
Just why they let me go.
But I'll never go dancing no more
'Til I dance with the dead.

You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back

The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath
As I plunge on into certain death, oh, oh

The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall

We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We were meant to fight another day, oh, oh

We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan, oh, oh

Hand of fate is moving

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death
Hello to eternity and live for every breath

The ferryman wants his money
You ain't going to give it back

As you set up off the track

Nothing you can contemplate

Every second is a new spark
Sets the universe aflame

You watch the world exploding every single night
Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light
Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain
The shadow of the wicker man is rising up again

And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life
What do you think you'd expect you would see?
Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life
And in the river reflections of me

Just for a second, a glimpse of my father I see
And in a movement, he beckons to me
And in a moment, the memories are all that remain
And all the wounds are reopening again

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

And as you look all around at the world in dismay
What do you see, do you think we have learned
Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray
Out in the streets where the babies are burned

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world
There are times I'm ashamed of us all
When you're floating on all the emotion you feel
And reflecting the good and the bad

Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?
Can you really tell me what life is?
Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you
Could be swept away by fate's own hand

We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

When you think that we've used all our chances
And the chance to make everything right
Keep on making the same old mistakes
Makes untipping the balance so easy

Say a prayer on the book of the dead
We're blood brothers
We're blood brothers

Have you heard what is coming to us all?
That the world as we know it will be coming to an end
Have you heard, have you heard?

He sees them in the distance when the darkened clouds roll
He could feel tension in the atmosphere
He would look in the mirror, see an old man now
Does it matter they survive somehow

They said there's nothing can be done about the situation
They said there's nothing you can do at all
To sit and wait around for something to occur
Did you know, did you know?

As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows
Wonders if they'll ever grow again
The desperation of the situation getting graver
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

Have you seen what they said on the news today
Have you heard what they said about us all
Do you know what is happening to just every one of us
Have you heard, have you heard?

There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen
There will be something that will light the sky
That the world as we know it, it will never be the same

Getting ready when the moment comes
He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two
Good to have because you never know

They only fill us with the stuff that they want
Did you know, did you know?

He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day
He's getting tired; that'll do for now
They are preparing for the very worst to come to them
Getting ready when the wild wind blows

He sees the picture on the wall, it's falling down
Upside down
He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face
Saying Grace

Remember times they had, they flash right through his mind
Left behind
Of a lifetime spent together long ago
Will be gone

They've been preparing for some weeks now
For when the crucial moment comes
To take their refuge in the shelter
Let them prepare for what will come

They make a tea and sit there waiting
They're in the shelter feeling snug
Not long to wait for absolution
Don't make a fuss; just sit and wait

Can't believe all the lying,
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit
Now the days of our ending have begun

Say a prayer when it's all over
Survivors unite, all as one
Got to try and help each other
Got the will to overcome

I can't believe all the lying
All the screens are denying
That the moments of truth have begun

Can't you see it on the T.V.?
Don't believe them in the least bit

Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes
The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout
Just another when the wild wind blows

Love is a razor and I walked the line
On that silver blade
Slept in the dust with his daughter
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence

Some day I may return

Don't you cry for me
Beyond is where I learn
Living on a razor's edge

I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that somethings watching you

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that somethings always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklores
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

And it doesn't have

Much time

'Cause at 5 o'clock
They take me

To the Gallows pole
The sands of time
For me

Are running low
Running low

When

The priest comes

To read me
The last rites

I take a look
Through the bars
At the last sights
Of a world
That has gone
Very wrong for me
Can it be that
There's some
Sort of error
Hard to stop
The
Surmounting terror
Is it really the end
Of some crazy dream
Somebody please
Tell me
That I'm dreaming
It's not easy
To stop
From screaming
The words escape me
When I try to speak
Tears flow
But why am I crying
After all
I'm not afraid
Of dying
Don't I believe
That there
Never is an end
As the guards
March me out
To the courtyard
Somebody cries
From a cell
"God be with you"
If there's a God
Then why has
He let me go?
As I walk
All my life
Drifts before me
Though the end
Is near
I'm not sorry
Catch my soul
It's willing
To fly away
Mark my words
Believe
My soul lives on
Don't worry now
That I have gone
I've gone beyond
To see the truth
When you know
That your time
Is close at han
Maybe
Then you'll begin
To understand
Life down here
Is just
A strange illusion
<EOS>
<BOS>
I'm gonna organize some changes in my life
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go

And I just feel I can be anything
That all I might ever wish to be
And fantasize just what I want to be
Make my wildest dreams come true

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
Out on the road again

When I remember back to how that things just used to be
And I was stuck inside a shroud of misery
I felt I'd disappeared so deep inside myself
I couldn't find a way to break away my hell

When I'm feeling down and low
I vow I'll never be the same again
I just remember what I am
And visualize just what I'm gonna be

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
Out on the road again

I'm on my way
Out on my own again
I'm on my way
I'm gonna breakaway

I was born into a scene of angriness and greed, and dominance and persecution.
My mother was a queen, my dad I've never seen, I was never meant to be.
And now I spend my time looking all around,
For a man that's nowhere to be found.
Until I find him I'm never gonna stop searching,
I'm gonna find my man, gonna travel around.

'Cos I'm a wrathchild,
well I'm a wrathchild.
Yeah I'm a wrathchild.
I'm coming to get you, oooh yeah.

Say it doesn't matter ain't nothin' gonna alter the course of my destination.
I know I've got to find some serious piece of mind, or I know I'll just go crazy.
But now I spend my time looking all around,
For a man thats nowhere to be found.
Until I find him I'm never gonna stop searching,

They can't stop us*
Let 'em try!
For heavy metal
We will die!

Quit my job this morning said; forever
I would hold my head up high.
Cause I need metal in my life,
Just like an eagle needs to fly.

So I walked outside into the street,
From a hall I heard thunder and screams.
I walked inside so I could hear,
And the guy beside me gave me a beer!

He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said; my friends
Are over there...

They call themselves immortals,
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment,
I was born again like you!

They said hold your head up high,
Raise your fist up in the air,
Play metal louder than hell!
Louder than hell!

They can't stop us,
Let 'em try!
For heavy metal
We would die!

Brothers stand beside me, as I battle on
Know my words are true.
There's a battle for true metal.
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you!

Ten thousand strong are here tonight,
With twenty thousand fists up in the air.
The power of true metal's calling you,
It's everywhere!

Hold your head up high,
Raise your fist up in the air,
Play metal louder than hell!
Louder than hell!

They can't stop us,
Let 'em try!
For heavy metal
We would die!

A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her pride
Hold your hammers high

Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky, I was born to die
Hear me while I live as I look into your eyes, none shall hear a lie

Power and dominion are taken by the will by divine right hail and kill

Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill

My father was a wolf, I'm a kinsman of the slain, sworn to rise again
Now I will bring salvation, punishment and pain

Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants, burn their homes till there's no blood left to spill

In the beginning there was silence
And darkness all across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burned high in the sky

From down below fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound

The Gods made heavy metal and they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than hell, we promised that we would
When losers say it's over with, you know that it's a lie
The Gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned
It's more than our religion
It's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal we can't forgive

'Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the Gods who made metal are with us tonight

The Gods made heavy metal and they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than hell, we promised that we would
When losers say it's over with, you know that it's a lie
The Gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

We believe in the power and the might
And the Gods who made metal are with us tonight

We're here tonight for heavy metal
Are you ready in the hall
They have chosen us and we have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound
Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal one and all

'Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the Gods who made metal are with us tonight

The Gods made heavy metal and they saw that it was good
They said to play it louder than hell, we promised that we would
When losers say it's over with, you know that it's a lie
The Gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

Hearts of steel
Killers of men

Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

Scorch the land

...Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still
they fought on
Blood poured fourth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
But Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth unto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods and men
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would harm them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day

He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye
Took his land and fortune
Left him to die

Bound on the shoreline
Left for the tide
Sees his life-blood leaving
Circling lower, the vultures fly

These bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the gods see his anguish
And give him a sign

From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
Ad they take him
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry

And in the world above
The elders sing
On his land they live
Let death's bell ring

He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls
The keeper of the unavenged

And he did say to him
"Let ye not pass, Abbadon
Return to the world
From whence you came"

"And seek payment
Not only for thine own anguish
But vindicate the souls
Of the unavenged"

And they placed in his hands
A sword made for him
Called, 'Vengeance'
Forged in brimstone

And tempered
By the woeful tears of the unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world

They brought forth their demon horse
Called, 'Black Death', a grim steed
So fearsome in might and black in color
That he could stand as one with the darkness

Save for his burning eyes of crimson fire
And on that night they rode up from hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder

Burning, death, destruction
Raping their daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives

No one can escape me
On black death, I ride
When kissed by the sword of vengeance
Your head lays there by your side

I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you

Burning, death, destruction
Raping their daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives

I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching

Hoping to gain their lives
But when I'm through
They know that they must pay

Burning, death, destruction
Raping their daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment

Into Glory Ride
March For Revenge (By The Soldiers Of Death)
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell

Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.

Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.

Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.

You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.

Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee
Conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand
Glory and a broken sword

I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard, breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield

Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight

Fierce is my blade, fierce is my hate
Born to die in battle, I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
They will know the power of my sword

There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain

Fierce is my blade, fierce is my hate
Born to die in battle, I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled

Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal
Would we fall? No

They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun

We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one

Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long

Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the takin', like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside, just climb, ooh

I am in the ground, I am in the air
I am all, I live in the hearts of men
I am the call to greatness, not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare

And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside

Prelude

 i) HECTOR STORMS THE WALL

 See my chariot run to your ships
 I'll drive you back to the sea
 You came her for gold
 The wall will not hold
 This day was promised to me
 The gods are my shield
 Lightning and javelins fly
 Soon many will fall
 We are storming the wall
 Stones fall snow from the sky

 We will pay with our glory
 In the fire of battle
 Zeus today is mine
 Killing all in my way
 Like sheep and like cattle
 Smashing skulls of all who defy
 I spare not the hammer
 I spare not the sword
 This day will ring with my name
 None have to chase me
 Let he who will face me
 Kill me or die by the sword

 ii) THE DEATH OF PATROCLUS

 Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
 This was your time, but the armor you
 wore was mine, I will not rest until
 Hector's blood is spilles
 His bones will all be broken
 Dragged across the field
 This dear friend is how we'll say
 Goodbye, until we meet in the sky

 iii) FUNERAL MARCH

 iv) ARMOR OF THE GODS

 v) HECTOR'S FINAL HOUR

 Here inside the walls of Troy, the gods weigh my 
 Fate from this bay do I abstain, to a memory of
 Hate to pay for all the blood that spilled
 the many thousands i did kill, no walls can
 contain the gods' almighty will

 I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
 The gods leave no choices so we all must die
 Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly,
 Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
 Today my mortal blood will mix with sand it was
 Foretold I will die by thy hand
 Into Hades my soul descend

 vi) DEATH HECTOR'S REWARD

 Cowards in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
 Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
 For all shall come to know me
 As they fall unto their knees
 Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny

 When the cards of life were bealt
 My hand a ruthless fate
 To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
 A bloodbath I was born to bring, by birth I'm
 an assassin
 To cut thr cord of life and death
 Ties to earth unfasten

 Blood and fire death and hate, your body I 
 will desecrate
 Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of
 Hades waits
 Kill...

 Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
 His body's mangled wounds
 The gods who once protected him are now his
 gods of doom,
 Like a tower standing tall, steadfast in direction
 I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give
 no protection
 Coward in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold
 Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
 For all shall come to know me, as they fall
 unto their
 Knees Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny

 Blood nd fire death and hate, your body I
 will desecrate
 Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of
 Hades waits
 Die die die die...

 vii) THE DESECRATION OF HECTOR'S BODY

 PART 1
 PART 2

 viii) THE GLORY OF ACHILLES

 The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
 In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
 See him Patroclus, down in the dust
 Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
 A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
 Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
 Their bodies set at the foot of your fire
 With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds

 Your funeral Pyre high off the ground
 Hector's body dragged three times around
 I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
 I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
 Hector's blood will not be washed from my body
 Until your body is burned
 A prophecy spoken a promise fulfilled
 More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

We ride down my enemies

No voice of mercy

With powers of evil
Dark knowledge is mine

The first sin was trust
Kill without warning

Never stopping for what's waiting soon will show
And this the last time looking back I'll see my home
For he awaits me reaching for my soul

He calls my name, and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame, oh

Well, the life that he has given full of riches and success
Has a price that I made good in blood to pay
And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if I falter on my way

And what God has now forsaken and man has never seen
Are the riches of the underworld below
All my years of earthly pleasures gave support unto the bridge
I now cross it giving him my soul

Dark Lord, I summon thee
Demanding the sacred right to burn in hell
Ride up on hells hot wind
Face one more evil than thou

Take my lustful soul, drink my blood as I drink yours
Impale me on the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evil
Lucifer is king praise Satan

I know the one who waits Satan is his name
Across the bridge of death there he stands in flame

The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade and borrow
But then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery

We welcomed them as brothers, knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted, as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among them free
Our trail of tears would end, one day at wounded knee

Great spirit, thunder birds fly
We are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky
Spirit horse ride for me

When we do the ghost dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war now blood and fire burn
Great spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky

Demon's blood and dragon's fire
Falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient Gods are calling me
I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic
I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible
I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me
They think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic
I am sworn
Hell is calling
We cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

I wear a sacred talisman
I make a secret sign
Now welcome me
Into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman
A dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open
Let me in

Rule in hell or serve in heaven
Choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge
Unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul

Wait for me, dragon
We'll meet in the sky
By fire and magic
I am sworn
Hell is calling
We cannot be denied
Fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

We thank you for the Kool-Aid, Reverend Jim
We're glad to leave behind their world of sin
Our lifeless bodies fall on holy ground
Rotting flesh, a sacrificial mound

Were you our God or a man in a play
Who took our applause and forced us to stay?
Now all together we lived as we died
On your command by your side

Guyana in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

In the cult of the damned, we all worked the land
Too afraid to look up, we all feared his hand

Hurry my children there isn't much time
But we'll meet again on the other side

Be good to the children and old people first
Hand them a drink, they're dying of thirst

Guyana in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand, oh

Guyana in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand, oh, oh

Bigfoot, Bigfoot thrown in a well
Pulled under water, screaming like hell
He told us life was just a hotel
Time to check out when he rang a bell

Guyana in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind and hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die

Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight through endless suffering
For all who believe, wait a crown, a ring
The power of the man who would be king
The power of the man who would be king

Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind knows nothings what it seems
The melting of the soul, the wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will by destroyers of the dream

They live to spread the fear of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power to fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged all across the land to be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

Time to face the world, let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try, they are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind that comes to fill the sail

For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive to be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

All of the dreams held deep inside, have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
Power of the men who would be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

For the glory of the king, we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive
Across the gates of heaven, beyond the gates of hell
We fought to stay together
We have won and lived to tell who would be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king
To be king

Secret Of Steel
Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.

There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.

A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.

Sons os destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.

Touching all our lives
As if he lived and died
In a single moment

Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died
A man of honor

For his life was the price
To pass the gates immortal

Thy journey begins
With sword in the wind
Stay thy hand rest thy command
For odin's call was heard above them all
Thy name shall never die!

Long shall we remember
He who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge
Death's no stranger

Blood and death lived on his sword
The god of war his only lord
Into the depths of hell
Go all he fell

Take thy shield take thy sword
All thy weapons to the sky
Ye shall need them when odin bid thee rise

For none but the brave
Shall rise up from the grave
To see the valkyries fly

And so it was by the hand of odin
Did the immortal warrior pass through
The gates of valhalla and into legend.

Rise brother rise pass valhalla's gates
Here great warriors await

Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed

From the earth to the sky
Now the son of odin rise!

Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never die!

Deep into the heart of the battle they fought. Covered on
All sides as all converged on them, until the four could
No longer be seen. As time passed I feared them lost, then
Slowly the armies separated, many were dead. I saw the four
Each down on one knee, all stopped to watch and gaze
Upon them with a smile of victory before sending them into
The ground.
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/manowar/glory+majesty+unity_20710855.html ]
Then they rose together to make a final stand. With their
Last bit of strength they raised their arms into the air pointing
Blood stained weapons to the sky. They called upon the god
Of war and made ready to die. But Odin would not call
Them this day to Valhalla, instead he sent thunder and
Lightning to strike the ground, bestowing upon them the
One gift every warrior lives in hope of - the berserker rage!

Now filled with that strength, the power of a thousand
Men was given them. No longer mortal they were touched
By the gods. This time when they took up the attack, men fell
Not by tens, but by hundreds, by thousands. And when the
Smoke did clear, the four spoke the words and the masses
Answered the response of the warrior's prayer.

Gods of war I call you
My sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor
Free from all false pride

I will crack the whip
With a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death
If I should ever fail

Glory, majesty, unity
Hail! Hail! Hail!

Riding, riding, riding, ain't never growin' old.

Take what I want and I go where I please
Got the world right by the balls. This world ain't
big enough to keep me down. Yea we're livin'

got lotsa trouble overseas, well what the hell

Stop sending money send'em all a bomb.

Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.

Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat.
Well they all want to know what people say is true,
You know, get a biker started 'n he'll drive all
damn night. Well hold on honey 'cause this ride's
for a ride.

Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
I'm the WARLORD of the road.
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.

Above the wreckage of your mortal world, I stand
Judgment passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man

What was written foretold in dreams
In visions apocalypse now seen
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger, die with the beast

Indication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night

Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride

Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne

His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man

Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride

Armed with magic, sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near
Maim and kill them, take the women and children

Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields
Maim and kill them, take the women and children

Fallen brother as I hold close to your side
I fear this wound, your last
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past

Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet
For when we march, your sword rides with me
For when we march, your sword rides with me
For when we march, your sword rides with me
For when we march, your sword rides with me

You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour, let your steel be tried
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plain
Kill me if you can, death is life

Did the immortal warrior pass through

With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armours shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now

Chorus:
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !

Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shade
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride

Chorus:
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !

To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind

Dark Avenger - (R Friedman, J Demaio)
----------------------------------------
He broke the laws of the elders
So they blocked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die

Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Seizes life, blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly

His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign

From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...

And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death bell ring

Narration:
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him:
"Let you not pass
Abandon
Return to the world
From once you came
And seek payment
Not only for thy known anguish
But vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged"

And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called: Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the Wolf in tears of the Unavenged

And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiercely might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one: Darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of grims and fire

And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder !

Chorus:
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In foul with their lives

No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you

Chorus:
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In foul with their lives

I spare that land of servants
My wake is slow dead there
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to get my life
But when I'm through they know they must pay

Chorus:
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In foul with they lives
With they lives

Walk between the world of men and gods
Cast no shadows, draw no light
I rape the priestess on pagan's night

I taste the serpent's poison
On the lips of the one I love
She brings this gift of witchcraft
I wear the cat skin gloves

Apples of youth when I wrought mischief
Hung in a tree to rot in the sun
Reborn in the middle of the final orgy
The gift of slavery to the chosen one

Suicide, suicide, don't you know me?
Call to the master, he will come
He will bring out resurrection
Cloaked in darkness, he has won

The isle of the blessed, grant my soul

Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Huginn and Muninn. They circle the Earth by day seeing all. At night they report to him the world's tidings. He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring. At his side sit two wolves. His weapons, a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir. They are carved with runes. His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land sea and air. The bringer of the valiant dead, the Einherjar. From the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.

For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye. He was granted supreme wisdom. He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death. Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days. Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself. Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree. In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him. He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection, success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.

His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth. He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!

On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!

I sing Yeah
Long time ago
You tried to tell me, son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no

No, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, fast taker, fast taker, fast taker
Take it away

Only sixteen
For more than not a girl
Old enough
For a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday
When daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching "Merry Granma" on T.V.

Oh yeah, he won't see me

Now do it right with music
Then you learn how to abuse it
All night, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For peace, fast taker, fast taker, fast taker
Take it away

Mama is having troubles,
It always comes from me
Your daddy said that drink is
Is not yours for the free
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like see 'em breed
But truth is in the mirror
Is one thing never seen

A long time ago
You tried to tell me son
People tried to hold on
I said no no, no no

No I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play
For keeps, fast taker, fast taker, fast taker

Metal Daze - (J Demaio)
--------------------------

I hear the sound
In a metal way
I feel the power
Rolling on the stage
'Cause only one thing
Really sets me free
Heavy metal
Loud as it can be

Baby I was born to play music
I am a man with a screaming guitar
There's a light in a middle of the stage
In a minute I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Baby I don't really care
Give me a pair of chains, aim the whiplash at me
The girls I'd love to share

Chorus:
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze

Living like there's no tomorrow
Yeah, I could resist we're all on the edge
This is: Man you really graft it
This band: A social waste
Well, we all got arms made of metal
And our glories are no deblock
And if I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock !

Chorus:
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal

So mister D. J.
Play just one for me
You know the one
With the crushin' and the screams
'Cause only one thing
Really sets me free
Heavy metal
Loud as it can be

Chorus:

Passing through the storm -
Led by demons - walk between the
World of men and gods -
Cast no shadows - draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.

I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.

Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief, hung in a tree to rot
In the sun. -
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy - a gift of slavery
To the chosen one.

Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me - call to the Master - he will
Come. - He will bring our
Ressurection - cloacked in darkness -
He has won.

Smoke of my sacrifice. -
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed. -
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time - I'm your guest.
Only I know why -

Each dawn I die.

They got nothing to say

I'm expendable that's my claim to fame
I'm expendable don't have to know my name

Take a look into my dark side
Oh that's a window to my soul
You're watching on the outside
Yeah that's all you people know
So bring a knife or a gun
And I'll show you what they're for
Both of them are fun
When the raven's at your door

I'm expendable that's my claim to fame
I'm expendable don't have to know my name

Cause I will survive
With no one left around me
Cause you're all gonna die

Together we ride
With vengeance inside
For our brother who died
We got blood on our minds

A hero was he
Touching all our lives
As if he lived and died
In a single moment
Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died
A man of honor
He paid with his life
For his life was the price
To pass the gates immortal
Thy journey begins
With sword in the wind
Stay thy hand rest thy command
For odin's call was heard above them all
Thy name shall never die!
Long shall we remember
He who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge
Death's no stranger
Blood and death lived on his sword
The god of war his only lord
Into the depths of hell
Go all he fell
Take thy shield take thy sword
All thy weapons to the sky
Ye shall need them when odin bid thee rise
For none but the brave
Shall rise up from the grave
To see the valkyries fly
And so it was by the hand of odin
Did the immortal warrior pass through
The gates of valhalla and into legend.
Rise brother rise pass valhalla's gates
Here great warriors await
Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed
From the earth to the sky
Now the son of odin rise!
Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never die!

Hail England did we

We fought the world
Kings of metal to be
Louder than hell
Warriors of the world

Stand our ground knights immortal
For metal once more

Hail, kill and die

Blood and steel bound together
In a fight to be free
We will arm the just
And grind to dust
Those who deny
Our sacred right
Of glory and might
We shall survive

Hail, kill and die

Dark avengers armed with hatred
Black arrows and wings
By the hammer of Thor
A holy war
For the crown and the ring

lusting for blood and death again

Descend to hell

The cardinal opens the church in the night
All dressed in his black velvet cape
The sinners will act as religion demands
All sins are confessed in his grace
At midnight he came
Confession his game
And no one could hear when they scream
Believe in the shame and carry the blame
No crime was seen

They call him Cardinal Sin
In the night
Cardinal Sin
Blind in light
They locked him in for cardinal sin
At midnight he came to kill
At midnight the trial will begin

The cardinal hides in the dark of the dome
No mortal can witness his name
He died for the lust of the flesh and the bone
The curse of the beast he became
At midnight he killed
Your blood will be spilled
And no one can hear when you cry
Possessed by the game
And blessed in his name before you die

They call him Cardinal Sin
In the night

Blind in light
They locked him in for Cardinal Sin

Paid for the kill, but it doesn't seem right

Voices are calling from inside my head

Always creeping up on you

Taught by the powers that preach over me

They'll remember, they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate

Warfare, pain and murder
in Golgatha we stand
for the last rite of heaven
the seventh sacrament

Born of blood and fire
and blessed by midnight's hand
in the core of the pyre
no sorrow we repent

And we ride by the storm
in the night we're reborn
and we carry our hearts to the dome
To the Bible we're sworn
in the dark we transform
and we die
by the dawn all alone

In the night we can't rest
in the dark we are blessed
and in moonlight we fight for the father
We are brave to the heart
blood and fire we part
and forever we pray for we are

Cursed by our desire,
and guided by our lust
holy father in heaven,

Blessed before the altar,
no life in celibate
for the call of the wicked,

And we die by the sword
undead life our reward
and we carry our lust all alone
To the Bible we're sworn
in desire transform
we're not blessed
when undressed to the bone

In the night we can't rest

As proud as we're dead, the werewolves are back
Countdown the strike and prepare for attack
Pray when we take your life on this side
And you know soon you'll be dying
Cold are your veins, and when you deny
Dark is the night and alone you will die
Break all the chains and wait for the time
When you return with the night

Dead boys don't cry
No wonder why
You'll see them ride the midnight sky
Dead boys don't cry
For they can't die
You'll see them light the grave goodbye
Dead boys don't cry

When we come near don't hide in your bed
One night in hell and you wake up undead
Dead when the day, alive in the night
Gone with the morning horizon
Don't you dare say, the damned you adore
When you decide you can't take any more
Phantoms we are, and lonesome we ride
Into the dark of the night

All we lust and hunger for is blood
All we need is lust for blood
All we need is lust

Stand up

That fought against Jerusalem
Their people will become like walking corpses,
Their flesh rotting away.
Their eyes will rot in their sockets,

Satani, Satani, in amus dignita
Satani, Satani, evade retro sagitta

We came to fight in the army of Christ
Armed with a fist full of steel
Send to inferno the demons allied
Prayer for prayer the deal

We are the storm and the wicked inside
More than a martyr can take
Fire them back to the dark of the night
Pray for this time we awake

And we all
Die, die, die tonight
Sanctified with dynamite
Die, die, dynamite
Halleluja!

We are damned in the night
Sanctified with dynamite
And at midnight we come for your blood
We are cursed and denied
Holy lord of dynamite
And at midnight forever we are
Die, die, dynamite
Born of tornado, we bring you the night
Pray for we all detonate
Heroes in heaven and servants in life
Kill us before it's too late

Like a messiah we end crucified
Into damnation we rode
Torn into pieces of soldiers divine
Ehre sei gott, we explode

And we all
Die, die, die tonight
Sanctified with dynamite
Die, die, dynamite
Halleluja!

We are damned in the night
Sanctified with dynamite
And at midnight we come for your blood
We are cursed and denied

Oh mother God we hold the sword in holy times
We are the war, we never see the light
The order call, we all will take more human wine
And we toast to the night
We fold our hands, we keep the bible in our minds
Oh father God, we are the hordes of Cain
And though you run we will take you and we find
Any type, any vein
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we open your veins
Oh father lord, we are the demons of the wild
When all we pray, stand the fight as one
We tame the storm, we are the martyrs in the light
Take your soul when you run
We are the dark, we are the saints of blood at night
We hear the call, when the moon shines red
We grab your body, in the morning all we are
Satisfied when you're dead
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we open your veins
We drink, we drink, we drink your blood
Kyrie eleison
We drink, we drink, we drink your blood
Kyrie eleison
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood

Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Nightcrawler

Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Nightcrawler

As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind

Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
Come to me it calls
Atmospheres electric
As it now descend the stairs

Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood

Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you

Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back

Beware the beast in black

Look through the people and on through the mist
To the hill of the headless cross
Where all witches meet, on a night such as this
And the power of darkness is host
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul
With an angel that fell from the sky
Borne on the air, lot of screams and the wails
Of the masses appointed to die

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's been no escape from the power of satan
On a nation so brave and so proud

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross

Ahahahohohoh ahahahohohoh
Ahahahohohoh ahahahohohoh
Ahhhhhhh

How do ya feel when the locks refuse the key?
And the master is calling your name?
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm?
Does the tallisman protect you from pain?

Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the headless cross, at the headless cross.

From the first evil night. When a black flash of light

As proud as we're dead, the werewolves are back
Countdown the strike and prepare for attack
Pray when we take your life on this side
And you know soon you'll be dying
Cold are your veins, and when you deny
Dark is the night and alone you will die
Break all the chains and wait for the time
When you return with the night

Dead boys don't cry
No wonder why
You'll see them ride the midnight sky
Dead boys don't cry
For they can't die
You'll see them light the grave goodbye
Dead boys don't cry

When we come near don't hide in your bed
One night in hell and you wake up undead
Dead when the day, alive in the night
Gone with the morning horizon
Don't you dare say, the damned you adore
When you decide you can't take any more
Phantoms we are, and lonesome we ride
Into the dark of the night

Dead boys don't cry
No wonder why
You'll see them ride the midnight sky
Dead boys don't cry

You'll see them light the grave goodbye

Warfare, pain and murder
in Golgatha we stand
for the last rite of heaven
the seventh sacrament

Born of blood and fire
and blessed by midnight's hand
in the core of the pyre
no sorrow we repent

And we ride by the storm
in the night we're reborn
and we carry our hearts to the dome
To the Bible we're sworn
in the dark we transform
and we die
by the dawn all alone

In the night we can't rest
in the dark we are blessed
and in moonlight we fight for the father
We are brave to the heart
blood and fire we part
and forever we pray for we are

Blessed and Possessed
Blessed and Possessed

Cursed by our desire,
and guided by our lust
holy father in heaven,
in sacristy we trust

Blessed before the altar,
no life in celibate
for the call of the wicked,
the wicked we await

And we die by the sword
undead life our reward
and we carry our lust all alone
To the Bible we're sworn
in desire transform
we're not blessed
when undressed to the bone

In the night we can't rest
in the dark we are blessed
and in moonlight we fight for the father
We are brave to the heart
blood and fire we part

Prone to the grave, the dark side you walk
in the light of the morning we fall
Confront teh brave, the rebel we stalk,
when we came - we saw - we conquered them all
Blessed when we die, confessed not a lie
in the still of the night we aware
Don't dare to cry, when fever up high
no escape - no break - your life we will take

Gone with the night
when the unholy demons of dawn
Pray
when the sunlight is dead we're reborn

We are dead until dark - when the night is calling
dead until dark - and at midnight high
dead until dark - and at dawn we all will die

We are dead until dark - when the Saints are crawling
dead until dark - and the demons fly
dead until dark - we unite the bloodred sky

Cursed by our fate, the undead crusade
for the sanctum deep under your skin
Raise up the blade, by night we invade
for the last - of times - the fight may begin
Murder bizarre, nocturnal we are
when we rise like the phantoms of dust
Sent from the dead, we long for the red
for in blood - in god - in heaven we trust
